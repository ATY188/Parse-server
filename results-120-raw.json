This would give a new leadership team ample time to settle in before Apple’s two biggest annual events: the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June and the iPhone launch in September.</p>\n    <p>Tim Cook, who turned 65 this month, took over the CEO role from co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. His tenure has been nothing short of transformative for the company’s business. Under his leadership, Apple’s market cap has exploded from around $350 billion in 2011 to a staggering $4 trillion today.</p>\n    <p>This potential leadership change also comes after other recent high-profile shifts in Apple’s executive team.

As Apple’s current senior vice-president of hardware engineering, Ternus is widely seen as the most likely candidate to take over from Cook. Appointing him would mark a return to a hardware-focused executive leading the iPhone maker, a significant move as Apple works to innovate in new product categories and advance its AI efforts.\nAccording to the Financial Times, “The company is unlikely to name a new CEO before its next earnings report in late January, which covers the critical holiday period.”\nSources familiar with the discussions suggest an announcement early in the year would be strategic. This would give a new leadership team ample time to settle in before Apple’s two biggest annual events: the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June and the iPhone launch in September.\nTim Cook, who turned 65 this month, took over the CEO role from co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. His tenure has been nothing short of transformative for the company’s business. Under his leadership, Apple’s market cap has exploded from around $350 billion in 2011 to a staggering $4 trillion today.\nThis potential leadership change also comes after other recent high-profile shifts in Apple’s executive team. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri stepped back from his role at the beginning of the year, and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams announced he was stepping down in July.\nTim Cook himself has previously stated his preference for an internal candidate, noting the company has “very detailed succession plans.” For now, all eyes are on the company’s performance this holiday season and any potential announcements in the new year.\nWhat do you think of John Ternus as a potential successor?

Conversely, a recovery above $3,400–$3,500 would be the first signal that bullish momentum is returning.\nDespite the pullback, analysts emphasize that large holders — including the #66kETHBorrow whale — continue to accumulate ETH, signaling strong conviction in the asset’s long-term potential. For now, Ethereum’s trend remains fragile, and bulls must defend the $3,000 region to prevent further downside momentum.\nFeatured image from ChatGPT, chart from TradingView.com",

Applied Materials delivered fiscal fourth quarter results above the midpoint of our guidance to complete another record year. 2025 was our sixth consecutive year of growth, and over this period, we have grown revenue and earnings at annualized rates of approximately 12-20%. These results are made possible by our passionate and dedicated employees around the world. Over the past twelve months, we have built new capabilities, strengthened our product portfolio, and streamlined our organization to prepare for the opportunities ahead. Applied is in a tremendous position to benefit as AI computing fuels secular growth in semiconductors and wafer fab equipment.</p>\n    <p>As this is our year-end call, I'll begin with a brief review of our performance in 2025, then I'll provide our latest market outlook, and finally, I'll describe how our inflection-focused innovation strategy enables us to extend our leadership in the most valuable and fastest-growing areas of the market as next-generation technologies ramp in volume production in 2026 and beyond.</p>\n    <p>Looking back at fiscal 2025, while it was a growth year for Applied, our growth rate was tempered due to increased trade restrictions and an unfavorable market mix. Over the past twelve months, multiple trade rule changes have reduced the size of our accessible market in China. Overall, China declined to 28% of our total systems and service revenues in fiscal 2025 and to 25% for our fourth quarter. In 2026, we expect wafer fab equipment spending in China to be lower, and we are not anticipating significant changes to market restrictions. In the areas of the market where we can operate, we are competing well and maintaining market share.</p>\n    <p>Outside of China, the fastest-growing areas of the market in 2025 were segments where Applied had low or no share. In leading-edge foundry logic, investment was more oriented toward advanced lithography. We believe this is a positive leading indicator for process equipment demand in 2026. NAND, where historically Applied has lower market share, is on track to approximately double in 2025, even though it remains a relatively small portion of the wafer fab equipment market. In DRAM, where Applied has strong process technology leadership, overall spending is tracking to be approximately flat for calendar 2025. Nevertheless, we strengthened our leadership position in DRAM, growing revenues from leading-edge customers by more than 50% over the past four fiscal quarters.</p>\n    <p>As we look ahead to 2026, we expect the spending mix to play more to Applied's strengths with leading-edge foundry logic, DRAM, and advanced packaging being the fastest-growing areas of the market.</p>\n    <p>I recently returned from an extended trip to Asia. My discussions with customers and partners reinforce my view that opportunities for the semiconductor industry and Applied Materials have never been greater. Our customers are engaging with us to ensure we are ready to support significant production ramps in the coming years. AI has reached a tipping point that is accelerating investment in next-generation computing infrastructure and advanced silicon. Today, we are seeing a virtuous cycle of innovation and demand advances in performance, energy consumption, and cost of AI computing open up new AI applications that in turn significantly increase demand for AI compute capacity. Recent third-party forecasts predict that the semiconductor industry will grow at a compound annual rate between 10 to 15% over the next five years, driving a healthy increase in wafer fab equipment spending. We expect 2026 to be another growth year for Applied, with our revenue being weighted toward the second half of the calendar year. AI computing is not only fueling growth but also reshaping the semiconductor roadmap and changing the way chips are designed and manufactured. Foundational semiconductor technology plays a critical role in increasing performance and bringing down the cost of AI in the data center and at the edge. Today, major technology inflections are underway in five key areas: leading-edge logic, high-performance DRAM, high-bandwidth memory or DRAM stacking, advanced packaging for heterogeneous integration, and power electronics. At Applied, our core strategy is inflection-focused innovation. We partner with our customers to see technology inflections early, we focus our research and development on the most critical and valuable challenges on their roadmaps using deep, co-innovation engagement models, and we create highly differentiated solutions by connecting our broad portfolio of capabilities and technologies.</p>\n    <p>The three products we recently launched at SEMICON West are great examples of how this strategy works. Our new Xterra epitaxy system enables higher performance gate-all-around transistors for two nanometers and beyond. Xterra creates void-free source drain structures that provide higher transistor speeds that are especially critical for AI computing. The Xterra system integrates Epi cleaning and etch, resulting in a 40% improvement in uniformity and 50% lower gas usage compared to traditional Epi. Connects is the industry's first integrated die-to-wafer bonder. Hybrid bonding enables significant improvement in performance, power consumption, and costs for both complex multichip packages and die stacking.</p>\n    <p>Connects is a six-step integrated system with onboard metrology that provides higher accuracy bonding, smaller interconnect pitches, and higher yields for new logic and memory packaging architectures. ProVision 10 is designed to improve yield in 3D devices and further extends our leadership in e-beam metrology. E-beam metrology is critical for 3D devices as it can see through multiple layers of 3D chips and provide multilayer images to identify defects in buried structures. This system is the first to use cold field emission technology for metrology, which increases image resolution by 50% and imaging speed 10 times compared to conventional thermal field emission technology.</p>\n    <p>Overall, Applied is very well positioned at the most valuable technology inflections and in areas of the market that will grow fastest as AI is deployed on a large scale. The process tool of record positions that we have established over the past several years give us confidence that we will extend our strong leadership position in logic, DRAM, and packaging as advanced technology nodes ramp in volume production. Another key theme we consistently hear from our customers and our customers' customers is that co-optimization of the technology stack is more critical than ever. We are expanding our deep multiyear co-innovation engagements that focus on system technology co-optimization.</p>\n    <p>Our high-velocity co-innovation model provides chip makers and chip designers much earlier access to next-generation process technology to accelerate their new chip and system architectures. This is a core value proposition of Applied Materials' equipment and process innovation and commercialization platform, or EPIC. Construction of the platform's flagship facility, the Epic Center in Silicon Valley, is on track, and we are excited to begin operations next year. Our co-optimization strategies extend well beyond R&amp;D. As our customers race to bring these complex new device architecture inflections to market, we are providing advanced service solutions that help them rapidly transfer new technology into their pilot lines and then rapidly optimize device performance, yield, and cost in volume production.</p>\n    <p>In 2025, our core service business delivered another year of double-digit growth, with more than two-thirds of our service revenue generated from subscriptions. In AGS and across Applied, we are rapidly adopting AI and digital tools. This enables us to drive higher velocity and productivity, innovate the way we work, and streamline our organization to meet the opportunities ahead.</p>\n    <p>Before I hand over to Brice, I'll quickly summarize. Fiscal 2025 was our sixth consecutive year of growth, even as trade restrictions and an unfavorable market mix trimmed our growth rate for the year. As we look ahead, large-scale AI adoption will drive substantial investment in AI computing infrastructure, including advanced semiconductors and wafer fab equipment. Applied's inflection-focused innovation strategy positions us for another record year in 2026 as we gain share at the highest value technology inflections in the fastest-growing areas of the market. As next-generation technologies ramp in volume production over the coming years, we will extend our leadership in logic, DRAM, and packaging. Brice, over to you.</p>\n    <p>Brice Hill: Thank you, Gary. Thanks, everyone, for joining today's call. I am pleased that Applied delivered record annual revenue, gross margin dollars, operating profit, and earnings per share in fiscal 2025. Looking ahead into 2026, I believe we are in a great position to benefit from favorable market trends. Based on growing demand for AI data center capacity, we forecast that leading-edge foundry logic, DRAM, and high-bandwidth memory will be the fastest-growing areas of the semiconductor equipment market. We have strong leadership positions in these segments today, and we have targeted our R&amp;D investments to create new products and technologies that will enable even faster and more energy-efficient transistors, chips, and systems, and drive growth for Applied.</p>\n    <p>In addition, we have been working closely with our customers to better understand their longer-term demand expectations and align our supply chain and manufacturing slots to meet their needs for advanced capacity. Based on our conversations with our customers and other industry players, we are preparing our operations and service organizations to be ready to support higher demand beginning in 2026.</p>\n    <p>Next, I'll briefly summarize our fiscal 2025 results versus fiscal 2024. Revenue grew 4% to $28.4 billion, with growth across all of our segments. Semiconductor systems revenue was up 4%, growing even as the impact of trade restrictions significantly reduced our access to the market in China. The impact of these restrictions was equivalent to around 10% of the China market in fiscal 2024, and more than double that amount in fiscal 2025. On a global basis, we generated record foundry systems revenue along with record DRAM sales outside China. And we posted record revenue in both Taiwan and Korea. Applied Global Services revenue grew 3% to a record $6.4 billion.</p>\n    <p>The recurring parts, services, and software portion of AGS grew by double digits in the year, while the 200-millimeter equipment business declined. Display revenue grew by 20%. I am pleased that we increased non-GAAP gross margin by 120 basis points to 48.8%, the highest level in twenty-five years. We shipped a richer mix of advanced systems and increased prices broadly, helping to more than offset cost increases. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 5%, primarily driven by a 10% increase in R&amp;D investments. At the end of the year, we announced actions to reduce headcount and enable us to scale Applied more productively as we capture the growth opportunities we see in 2026 and beyond.</p>\n    <p>We continue to shift spending to strategic areas, adding people in fields like advanced analytics that are critical to the speed and efficiency of our R&amp;D programs and operations. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased 9%. We generated nearly $8 billion in cash from operations. Free cash flow of $5.7 billion included elevated capital spending of $2.3 billion, over half of which was used in building the new Epic Center in Silicon Valley, which will open next year and become the most advanced, collaborative semiconductor equipment and process innovation facility in the world. We distributed approximately $6.3 billion to shareholders.</p>\n    <p>We paid $1.4 billion in cash dividends, and the quarterly dividend per share was increased by 15% during the year to 46¢. Operating income from Applied Global Services more than covered the dividend payment. We allocated $4.9 billion to our share repurchase program and reduced shares outstanding by more than 3%.</p>\n    <p>Turning to fiscal Q4, we delivered revenue and non-GAAP EPS above the midpoint of guidance. China revenue declined to 29% of total company revenue, which is in line with our longer-term average and well below a peak of 45% in 2024. Non-GAAP gross margin was at the midpoint of guidance and up 60 basis points year on year, while non-GAAP operating expenses were slightly higher than our expectation and up 3% year on year. Turning to the segments, Semiconductor Systems and AGS revenue exceeded our expectations for the quarter, while non-GAAP operating margin for both segments declined along with revenue on a year-on-year basis. Lastly, Display revenue exceeded our expectation for the quarter and was up 68% year over year.</p>\n    <p>Next, I'll share several reporting changes we are making that will help us drive further efficiency gains and also give investors more visibility into our semiconductor and services businesses. First, as of Q4 fiscal 2025, our display business is being reported in corporate and other. There is no change to our display strategy. Next, as of Q1 fiscal 2026, we are moving our 200-millimeter equipment business from Applied Global Services to Semiconductor Systems. This change will increase our operational efficiency and enable investors to see all of our semiconductor systems revenue in one place. Also, as a result, Applied Global Services will consist entirely of recurring revenue.</p>\n    <p>This will make it easier for investors to track our subscription-like growth and services. Finally, as of 2026, we are fully allocating corporate support costs to our businesses. This change will have the effect of reducing semiconductor systems and AGS operating margins, but also give our teams better visibility and opportunity to optimize these costs.</p>\n    <p>Now I'll share our guidance for Q1, which includes the reporting changes I just outlined. We expect company revenue of $6.85 billion, plus or minus $500 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $2.18, plus or minus 20¢. Within this outlook, we expect semiconductor systems revenue of around $5.025 billion. AGS should generate revenue of around $1.52 billion. Corporate and other revenue should be around $305 million, composed primarily of display revenue. We currently expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 48.4% in Q1 and remain at that level until volumes ramp to support higher demand beginning in the second half of the calendar year.</p>\n    <p>Non-GAAP operating expenses should be around $1.33 billion, which is up only slightly from fiscal Q4 because the actions we recently took are mostly offsetting the increase we normally see in Q1 due to the timing of annual merit increases and equity compensation expenses. Finally, we are modeling a tax rate of around 13%.</p>\n    <p>In summary, our customers are indicating to us that wafer fab equipment spending is likely to accelerate beginning in 2026. In addition, we see a positive fab equipment spending mix developing for Applied. AI data center investments translate to strong demand for our most enabling products in leading-edge foundry logic, DRAM, and high-bandwidth memory, along with advanced services that help our customers accelerate ramps and yields. Thank you for listening. Now, Mike, let's begin the Q&amp;A.</p>\n    <p>Mike Sullivan: Thanks, Bryce. To help us reach as many people as we can on today's call, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow-up question. Operator, let's please begin.</p>\n    <p>Operator: Certainly. And our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.</p>\n    <p>C.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Gary, the world has clearly changed since NVIDIA reported August 26 and discussed $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending. Curious, you know, given your trip to visit with clients, over the very near term, how your conversations have evolved in the last few months, how has your visibility changed, and how are you preparing your supply chain for this likely tremendous growth?</p>\n    <p>Gary Dickerson: Hi, C.J. Thanks for the question. Yeah. I have been spending a lot of time with customers and just came back from a long trip to Asia. And I would say, you know, I was meeting with the R&amp;D leaders and CEOs of our largest customers, and just like you said, AI is the biggest focus for all of our customers. It's driving the WFE mix to segments driven by AI, leading-edge foundry logic, and DRAM where Applied has strong number one positions. And, you know, Applied is in deep high-velocity co-innovation relationships with all of these different customers. We have very high share.</p>\n    <p>If you look at the transistor for gate-all-around or backside power, in leading-edge foundry logic, we have very strong visibility and co-innovation relationships with customers over four technology nodes a decade out in the future. So very high visibility in terms of our position. In leading-edge foundry logic and in DRAM, and high confidence we're going to outperform as those advanced chips ramp going forward in the future. The other thing that I heard and we've been seeing over the last couple of months is a major improvement in customer demand visibility.</p>\n    <p>Customers, just like you said, they're planning large ramps of advanced factories and they want to make sure our supply chain operations and service teams are ready to deliver. So we're getting more than one year visibility, in some cases, two years visibility with a number of these different customers because as we talked about in the prepared remarks, in '26, we will see significant ramps for these advanced factories. And, again, customers want to make sure that, especially, our supply chains are ready to deliver. And, of course, the improved visibility is critical to our ability to ensure on-time delivery to customer needs. But I'd say that's, C.J., the biggest thing that's changed in the last couple of months.</p>\n    <p>C.J. Muse: Very helpful. And then maybe, Bryce, you know, you announced the headcount reduction over the last quarter. I'm curious how we should think about that and the implications to gross margins and OpEx into the first half of calendar '26. Perhaps versus the second half given the ramp that you've talked about? Thank you.</p>\n    <p>Brice Hill: Yeah. Thanks, C.J. Good to hear from you. So on the reduction, if you look at our Q1 spend in our guide, you'll see that we don't have the uplift that we typically have for our annual pay raises and the share-based compensation increases in Q1. Typically happen. So you'll be able to quantify the rough change in that quarter from that perspective. And just to highlight, you know, that was a years-long program that we worked on to increase velocity and productivity across the company. And for the balance of 2026, we'll add back some skills that we need to fill in for the company.</p>\n    <p>So it's really a wholesale evaluation of all the staffing models we have across the entire company.</p>\n    <p>Gary Dickerson: Yeah. C.J., maybe I'll add one another aspect to this. In strategic planning, we had a big focus on innovating the way we work, including AI and digital technologies. And driving, like Bryce said, higher velocity and productivity. That's really at the foundation of how companies compete. So huge focus, especially on velocity, across all of Applied Materials, and then streamlining our organization to optimize future performance. And as we went through these changes, we also wanted to make sure, as I talked about, we see significant demand coming from our customers.</p>\n    <p>So we wanted to make sure as we're doing this overall company and workforce optimization, to improve the performance of Applied, we're also ready to meet those major customer ramps in '26 and then going forward.</p>\n    <p>Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Your question, please.</p>\n    <p>Krish Sankar: Thanks for taking my question. Gary, my first question is, as you mentioned, you're clearly gaining share in new technologies like gate-all-around and backside power delivery. But when I look at your leadership product, it seems like PVD is moving to ALD. On the CVD, CMP, and etch side, besides the usual US and Japanese competitors, there's increasing domestic China competition. I'm kind of curious how to think about the momentum in those leadership products for the next two, three years as you see increasing competition both globally and from China. And then I have a follow-up for Bryce.</p>\n    <p>Gary Dickerson: Okay, Krish. There's a lot in that first question, but thank you for the question. So we have very strong positions, gate-all-around, and backside power. Besides being number one in process equipment for leading logic and foundry, we're also number one in DRAM and advanced packaging, especially for high-bandwidth memory. And those are the most important segments for AI energy-efficient computing, and leading-edge foundry, logic, and DRAM will be the fastest-growing segments in '26 and for the next several years. And, Krish, we're performing well across all our products. Again, I am extremely confident that we will grow share in these segments that are enabling AI energy-efficient computing.</p>\n    <p>Again, we have deep relationships with all of these different customers across multiple technology nodes, you know, we see strong demand for our products. Increasing demand for integrated systems for transistors, wiring, and now Connects for packaging. So all of that, I'm very optimistic about. And I'll come back to your PVD comment in just a minute here.</p>\n    <p>The biggest change we've seen in our competitive position in the near term is trade restrictions. We used to serve the entire global WFE market before restrictions were implemented. By 2024, we were restricted from serving around 10% of China's WFE market, mainly in leading-edge logic and the domestic NAND market. And then in the last month of 2024 and the first month of 2025, the restrictions significantly increased for us. And we could no longer serve China's DRAM market and some of the ICAPs market.</p>\n    <p>So our impact grew to well over 20% of the China WFE market, which I think everybody knows that the WFE market in China has been elevated this year and also over the past few years, with China approaching 40% of total WFE. So this change in restrictions was a very big impact, especially in 2025. And non-US equipment companies don't have the same restrictions. And so restricted customers can buy from those companies even if they would rather buy from Applied. And we've put a lot of time and studied this topic very carefully. And what we can see is that where we can compete, we are doing very well.</p>\n    <p>And then if I look at China going forward, our business has returned to normalized levels. We talked about kind of mid-twenties on our semi-business, our systems in AGS. And looking ahead, we don't anticipate significant new restrictions. In fact, we believe that our share in China ICAPs where we can compete was flat from 2024 to 2025, and that's across Krish, all of our different leadership products. And we think we can continue to hold and have an opportunity to even gain share going forward. And I say this because we have several major ICAPs new products coming for China and non-China.</p>\n    <p>That add to the strong products we have today, enabling us to enter new ICAPS markets and also better compete in cost-sensitive areas of the market. So we will increase our ICAP's addressable market opportunity in China and worldwide. And, again, where we can compete, I'm actually very optimistic with our position.</p>\n    <p>And then back to PVD, your question on PVD. So I'll tell you, Krish, PVD is doing great where we can compete. We grew PVD in '25. We have a positive outlook in '26 and into the future. And we talked, you know, talked earlier about AI. PVD is enabling low-resistance wiring, and that's critical for faster and more energy-efficient chips. And if with advanced chips, you have hundreds of miles of wiring in a single chip. And if you could imagine, you know, though that long wire keeps getting thinner and thinner, and moving data through that wire at high speed with low power is incredibly hard, almost like magic, and Applied is the clear leader in wiring innovation.</p>\n    <p>So Krish, we see strong demand for PVD. Strong growth in 2026 and into the future. We're also innovating. I talked about that pipeline of innovative products. We have new PVD innovations specifically for ICAPs beyond all of the other things that we're doing that will help us in performance in that particular segment. And then the last thing, you know, on the leading edge, we do have an increase in demand for the integrated products, including selective ALD and selective moly, which we just had some big wins in the most critical applications. So long answer, Krish.</p>\n    <p>Krish Sankar: Thank you very much, Gary. No. It's extremely helpful and very informative. Thanks for that. Just a quick follow-up for Bryce. Bryce, how do you think about the impact of this 200-millimeter movement from AGS to semi? Is there a way to quantify it for Q1? Or how much was it in FY '25? Thank you.</p>\n    <p>Brice Hill: It's approximately $125 million, Krish, for Q1 and approximately the same number in Q4. So, we're moving that from our services business to our equipment business. And we think that'll be easier for us to manage and easier for investors to understand those two different reportable segments.</p>\n    <p>Krish Sankar: Thanks, Bryce. Thanks, Gary.</p>\n    <p>Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please.</p>\n    <p>Vivek Arya: Thank you for taking the question. You mentioned you expect fiscal 2026 mix to work in your favor. You also mentioned the significant growth in the back half. I'm curious, do you think there is a potential for WFE to grow high single-digit, you know, close to double-digit next year and for Applied to outperform that? Because you do seem to have better visibility, and you also expect the mix to work in your favor. So I'm just hoping that if you could give us some sense of what the market, you know, could be doing and how is Applied positioned with respect to that market.</p>\n    <p>Brice Hill: Hi, Vivek. It's Bryce. Thanks for your question. We do expect strong growth in '26 led by leading edge and DRAM. The headwind that we have, we do still expect some digestion in China and in ICAPs. So it's kind of a similar, you know, situation relative to 2025, but we think leading edge will be very strong. DRAM will be very strong. These are pulled by the, you know, headline of the AI solutions in those spaces. And then a little bit of digestion on the ICAP side, but we do think it will be a growth year.</p>\n    <p>Vivek Arya: Okay. On the, you know, clarification side, right, how much of the $600 million BIS headwind is in Q1 and the rest of the year? And if I could squeeze in the real question for Gary. One of your peers suggested an $8 billion or so, I think, WFE for every $100 billion or so in data center build-out. Do you agree with that number? Do you have a different number? And how do you see the mix within that $8 billion playing to Applied's strength? Thank you.</p>\n    <p>Brice Hill: Okay, Vivek. So starting with the affiliate rule, that, you know, came out and affected our Q4 and then was suspended. So we had shared that $110 million would be affected in our Q4. We didn't ship that in Q4, but we will ship that in Q1. So the first answer is that's included in our guide for Q1. And then the $600 million is still a good estimate for what's in the rest of 2026. And, you know, we didn't share any linearity for that. And in fact, it's still being closed in terms of delivery dates, etcetera. So I would think of that as through the rest of the year.</p>\n    <p>And then on the WFE per gigawatt, we spent some time thinking about this. We think the best way to think about this is about 15% of leading-edge wafer starts and DRAM wafer starts are allocated towards AI data center solutions. So if you think about capacity planning, that's growing at a mid-30s CAGR across the industry. So today, 15% of those two end markets growing at mid-thirties. And so for companies that are planning capacity for two and three years out, they make that projection, and that much WFE should be allocated towards data center.</p>\n    <p>So we can talk more about that in a follow-up, but I think that's a good way to think about how much is being allocated.</p>\n    <p>Gary Dickerson: Hi, Vivek. You asked about, you know, what does that mean, the AI demand mean for mix and, you know, for Applied. So I talked about this earlier that the two fastest-growing segments for '26 and going forward are leading-edge foundry logic and DRAM, including high-bandwidth memory. And in both of those cases, again, we're clear number one. We're gaining share, high visibility, and gate-all-around, and that'll become clear as those advanced factories ramp in the latter half of '26. Again, we have very strong visibility, very strong position. And the same thing is true with DRAM.</p>\n    <p>And I think longer term, you know, if you look at gate-all-around backside power, we're positioned to capture more than 50% of our served market. So I have high confidence that we are gaining share and gate-all-around. I mean, that's all of the discussions I had with these R&amp;D leaders when I was in Asia in the last month. And then DRAM high-bandwidth memory, we're in a really great position there. We've gained a significant amount of share over the last several years. As FinFET ramps, you know, we have strong leadership in FinFET. That's going to be adopted in DRAM four f squared. We're also in a great position.</p>\n    <p>And then in HBM, future generations will adopt hybrid bonding where we also have clear leadership. We announced Connects at SEMICON West. So the mix is definitely working in our favor. And we're well-positioned going forward.</p>\n    <p>Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please.</p>\n    <p>Stacy Rasgon: For the first one, Bryce, this second half lift in demand, so what does that imply for the trajectory in the first half? Like, are you thinking revenue stays kind of in this ballpark until we hit the second half, or does it grow a little bit and then it grows a lot? Maybe even if you wanted to quantify, like, second half versus first half split or something like that. But how do we think about the first half relative to the second half given the lift in the second?</p>\n    <p>Brice Hill: Yeah. For the semi-business, Stacy, and thanks for the question. For the semi-business, we think it'll be flattish until we see that growth. We will see a little growth in the AGS business. We expect AGS to be growing at low double digits, and that's fairly continuous growth through the course of the year. For the semi-business in the short term, it'll be flattish. Until, like, Q3, I guess, you're thinking? Or, yeah. For us, it'll really be our Q4 and our Q1 of next year. So that's when the calendar, you know, that's when it matches the calendar. So we'll see a significant uplift there from leading edge, especially. And until then, you know, it'll be slower growth.</p>\n    <p>Stacy Rasgon: Okay. And I guess for my follow-up, you sort of mentioned gross margins kind of staying in this range until we see that lift. So do you expect a material lift in gross margins when that material lift in revenue comes through? Or like how do we expect, like, the gross margin trajectory on the back of those revenues as that comes through?</p>\n    <p>Brice Hill: The 48.4% guide for Q1 is good for this level of business, and I'll just highlight in Q1, we're also expecting a normal share from a China shipment perspective. So it should be for the whole company, it should be in the order of 29% and less than that for AGS and our semi-business. So that level, you know, without a significant uplift in the business, that's good for this size business. And then when we do get to the second half, added volume will help with cost improvements. And then over time, we continue to work on our pricing and cost programs.</p>\n    <p>So you can see with the 120 basis point uplift that we had in 2025, most of that was driven by price improvement. So we'll continue with that program, but it takes time to, you know, to affect the margins.</p>\n    <p>Gary Dickerson: Stacy, this is Gary. One thing I'd say in terms of margins, I do think that we will be able to drive sustainable improvements in margins over time. I mean, one thing in the industry, you see a tremendous amount of profits being generated with the AI demand throughout the entire ecosystem. And so our customers' profitability has improved significantly. And as I mentioned earlier, also, we're enabling these incredible innovations. I mentioned the hundreds of miles of wiring in an advanced chip. I mean, again, for AI, this is incredibly valuable.</p>\n    <p>So as we continue to work with our customers enabling those innovations that are critical for AI, bringing new products to market, you know, I believe that we can sustainably drive our margins higher going forward.</p>\n    <p>Stacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you, guys.</p>\n    <p>Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.</p>\n    <p>Timothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Bryce, I'm trying to understand China a little better. So all these affiliates were banned, and then they got reinstated. And the way that China usually operates is that when they were rushing to get in front of the ban, and now I would think that they're gonna come back, and they're gonna just try to get as much equipment as they can as fast as they can. So is the add-back not gonna be more than $600 million, and in fiscal Q1, like, are you taking slots away from other customers to give to them?</p>\n    <p>I guess I'm trying to figure out how we don't add more than $600 million back the way that these, you know, Chinese customers typically operate.</p>\n    <p>Brice Hill: Thanks for the question, Tim. So, yeah, for the first quarter, $110 million is in the quarter. Those tools are built and will ship. For the balance, we weren't building those tools. You know, we didn't know we would be able to ship them, and so it's going to take time to do the supply chain and actually make the builds, and we'll have to finalize the date with the customers. So they may have interest in working that process as quickly as possible, but I would just say the good way to think about this is cycle time, and we'll spread it through the year.</p>\n    <p>Timothy Arcuri: Okay. And then, I guess, Gary, I want to go back to PVD. So this is about 30% or so. I mean, for Gartner, so it's a super important piece of your business. And it does seem a little bit like ALD is eating into this franchise a little bit. You know, I know it's super important. It's been growing, but how do you sort of protect that franchise from, you know, you have one franchise you're very strong in and then one where your share is not high. Do you think that we're all kind of with, our new leaders for our top customers? And, you know, we have deep visibility into their technology roadmap for four generations.</p>\n    <p>And I can tell you, again, we have high confidence. PVD is gonna continue to ramp. I mentioned a hundred miles of wiring in an advanced chip. And, you know, we have innovations, really amazing innovations, and we are the leader in wiring. So if you think about an AI server, again, how you move the data at a very high speed with low power is enormously important. That's within a chip, chip to chip. There's so much innovation that's happening. But I don't know where this comes from on the ALD eating PVD share, that type of thing. All I can say is that we have extremely high visibility. We have unique technologies, including PVD.</p>\n    <p>We have a unique ability to combine technologies and integrated platforms. One of those integrated platforms, we combined selective ALD together with PVD and five other technologies. That's part of what's enabling those hundreds of miles of wiring. Applied is really unique in being able to deliver those kinds of innovations. And that is enabling a 50% improvement in resistivity. It's a billion-dollar business for us every year. And so, you know, that is going to continue. Again, deep visibility into every input one, input two, input three, input four technology nodes. Another innovation that we just won with leading-edge logic companies is integrating selective Moly with PVD into an integrated platform for the most critical applications for our customers.</p>\n    <p>So, again, Tim, very high visibility, with you. It's a great business. It's gonna keep growing in '26 and keep growing as we go forward.</p>\n    <p>Timothy Arcuri: Okay. Thank you.</p>\n    <p>Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Adam Mullen from Citi. Your question, please.</p>\n    <p>Adam Mullen: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions, welcome back, Mike. Bryce, I understand that the China commentary you're expecting China to kind of stay at the mid-twenties level for the silicon products into next year. The assumption is that domestic China spending is coming down next year. You know, why would it be lower than the mid-5% and especially China is growing? I'm trying to understand the moving pieces.</p>\n    <p>Brice Hill: Yes. Thank you, Adam. Yeah. So for Q1, that just happens to be what's in the mix. But we do expect it, you know, if we do have the digestion that we're expecting in China, then we will see it lower during the course of the year. And they'll be more than offset, you know, to get growth here, they'll be more than offset by the strength in Leading Edge and DRAM that we highlighted earlier. So and, you know, we'll just admit. I think we've been wrong for two years in a row. Forecasting a digestion related to China, and it's stronger each year. We could be surprised on the upside, you know, as we go through.</p>\n    <p>But right now, Gary mentioned this a few minutes ago. China, you know, has almost been almost 40% of WFE. It's been elevated. They've been investing heavily to get to, you know, sustain self-sustainability from a production perspective. So it's, you know, we don't have as good of visibility because of a large number of customers there and the continuing creation of new customers. So it's not as easy to forecast as, you know, the rest of the mature market.</p>\n    <p>Gary Dickerson: I have one thing I say also, longer term, what we think is that ICAPs remains about one-third of WFE, and then you have, you know, memory and leading-edge foundry logic. So China is really mostly an ICAPs market, and there has been a delta spending over multiple years. We think that if you just look at end market demand, you know, we think that moves back into that ZIP code over a longer period of time. And when that happens, it's hard to anticipate exactly when that's going to happen, but that's when we think over a longer period.</p>\n    <p>Adam Mullen: Great. And then, Gary, one for you. You visited several customers. You know, are your memory customers constrained by shell capacity? And why are you talking about the second half? Inflection of the first half? I mean, I understand the fact that it's being dragged lower by China, but is there a situation where the memory guy is constrained by shell capacity?</p>\n    <p>Brice Hill: Well, I can take the question, Adam. So first, I would say that factory schedules, of course, matter. So each company, each customer has their own schedule for, you know, installation and ramp, the qualification, and the like. Our information on a macro level, we had several people ask this question, our information on a macro level suggests that there is, you know, factory capacity from a space perspective to ramp across the industry. And then you'll just have to ask each customer. That's a macro answer. You'll have to ask each customer for their situation. We don't think the capacity is limiting the ramp at this point.</p>\n    <p>Adam Mullen: Thank you.</p>\n    <p>Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Charles Shi from Needham. Can I get your question, please?</p>\n    <p>Charles Shi: Thanks for taking my question. I have a follow-up on China. You did mention outside of restrictions, you are not losing share. But your European peer, the closest one, reported much stronger China revenue growth this year. I think they're probably growing at 100% year-on-year. You're probably declining more than 10% year-on-year. So just really trying to reconcile how you're losing share. Yeah. Either users that would make anything and that would suggest you actually did not lose share in China? Despite the numbers we suggest otherwise. Thank you.</p>\n    <p>Brice Hill: Hi, Charles. I'll start on this one. So I think the nuance, you know, we clarified that. We made an adjustment in there and said, if we look at the accounts that we can support, we're holding our share and competing well in China. And just take the macro number, we certainly lost share in China. I think Gary commented if you go back to 2024, just over 10% of the market was restricted for US companies. If you go to 2025, it's more than doubled. The restriction has more than doubled. So we certainly lost share in China because a larger portion of the market is inaccessible to us.</p>\n    <p>But when we look at the accounts that we can sell to, we feel we're competing very well.</p>\n    <p>Gary Dickerson: Yeah. Charles, it's Gary. I think we have done a lot of work on this. So and there's a lot of different sources of data that can cross-validate the numbers. And, again, we look at we can't comment on other people. You know? Their ability to serve global customers in China versus domestic customers. You know, everybody's gonna have a little difference in terms of what, you know, what they're serving in China. Certainly for us, NAND, the global NAND in China, is not a significant business. DRAM, however, really was restricted at the, you know, at the beginning of our fiscal year, we have very high share in DRAM.</p>\n    <p>If you look at the top the leading DRAM companies, last year, I think our business was up something like 50%. And so for Applied, DRAM going away had a really big impact on us. So again, Charles, I think we have pretty good confidence maintaining share where we can compete. It will be a different mix for every company.</p>\n    <p>Brice Hill: Like if you want anything.</p>\n    <p>Charles Shi: No. I think that covers it. Yeah. The only other thing I would add to that, Charles, the other part of that is not only the DRAM, but it's NAND. So if you think about what was shipping? You have multinational NAND companies that are in China. And they were, you know, presumably pretty strong. And as you may know that in our mix, that's the lowest area for us. So Gary talked about the DRAM impact. The other impact is NAND strong. And both of them in that equation, in the future, on a global basis, we think is changing.</p>\n    <p>Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.</p>\n    <p>Joe Quatrochi: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could help us understand what was the size of the impacting business in fiscal 2025 and how did that grow?</p>\n    <p>Brice Hill: Hi, Joe. It's Bryce. It's a little bit lower than it was in 2024. So 2024 was buoyed by, you know, the shipments, the high shipments at the end of the year for HBM. So essentially, it's been running at the same level for 2025. Minus, you know, that shipments at the end of that year. So and then as we look forward, you know, Gary is, like, going to comment about the technologies for advanced packaging over time. We think we're well-positioned for that. We still think that business will be growing significantly along with the AI data center and all the different packaging capabilities that will be required over time.</p>\n    <p>Gary Dickerson: Yeah. Joe, so Applied is number one in high-bandwidth memory. So that doesn't not as strong as '25 as it was the previous year. So that was one thing that, you know, impacted our relative growth rate. But, you know, it's pretty close to flat year over year. '25 versus '24, the HBM coming down. Versus where it was. What I'm saying is that we're still on track to what we discussed before. We've grown the business around $500 million to about $1.5 billion today. And we're on track still to double this business to $3 billion or more over the next few years. And I think we're really in a very good position.</p>\n    <p>Like I said earlier, we're number one in HBM, so as HBM ramps over time, that puts us in a good position. We have a great portfolio of products. And especially, this is I mentioned the trip in Asia and meeting with a lot of these R&amp;D leaders. There's an enormous focus for our customers to go to larger packaging sizes so they can connect more GPUs, CPUs, and all these different computing components to improve performance and power an enormous amount. And so Applied is extremely well-positioned in HBM, and we're also well-positioned as these technologies ramp in the future. So I think high confidence in being able to double this business again over the next few years.</p>\n    <p>Joe Quatrochi: That's helpful detail. Maybe the follow-up on the China entity. With $600 million that then it comes back here. Any help on what the split of that was for, like, AGS in terms of service, I assume that would be basically just kind of turn right back getting your able to service the customers?</p>\n    <p>Brice Hill: Yeah. You're right. There was some AGS in that. We didn't offer that. I don't have it at my fingertips. So, there was a component of AGS. But I think the majority was equipment.</p>\n    <p>Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Shane Brett from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.</p>\n    <p>Shane Brett: Thank you for letting me ask the question. The first question is, you mentioned that your revenue from leading-edge customers grew 50% in 2025.</p>\n    <p>Brice Hill: Yeah. I'll start, Shane. So, you know, when you do the year-over-year comparison, it looks flat for us from a DRAM perspective, but what was happening in 2020 we shipped a significant amount of business to China customers. And so we basically have the same business in 2025 without the China customers. So all of that business went to the internationals, and that equated to approximately 50% growth for them. And we do expect, you know, DRAM to strengthen as we go into '26. It should be healthy growth across the customers for DRAM investments.</p>\n    <p>Gary Dickerson: Yeah. So in terms of, you know, where are we gaining? Certainly, I mentioned earlier high-bandwidth memory. That's one part that, you know, one segment where Applied is clear number one, and that is helping us. DRAM companies are driving innovation. In IO. Applied really leverages a lot of our leadership products and foundry logic. In fact, they're moving to FinFET going forward. That puts Applied in a good position. Even to gain more shares, go forward. We have a strong position in capacitor scaling. We have a really strong etch share in DRAM, and we've achieved patterning share gains. Those are a few areas.</p>\n    <p>Again, I would say going forward, as these DRAM companies adopt hybrid bonding for HBM, as they adopt FinFET, as they adopt four f squared, the vertical channel transistor architecture, and all of those areas we're positioned to gain share as those new technologies ramp.</p>\n    <p>Shane Brett: Got it. Thank you. And the second question may be a little bit critical, but your fiscal 2025 foundry logic revenue is up about 3% year over year, your US peers should be on the level playing field with that. Why can't you outperform in '26? Thank you.</p>\n    <p>Gary Dickerson: So foundry logic includes both leading-edge and, you know, ICAP's customers. So, you know, those two things are mixed together. You look, we had record revenue in Taiwan, record revenue in Korea. And so, you know, our performance is extremely strong in the leading edge. Revenue was up a significant amount. So you have all those things kind of mixed together. I think, in those in that data and because everybody's combining that.</p>\n    <p>Shane Brett: Thanks, Shane. I'll help you rest on for one more question, please.</p>\n    <p>Operator: Certainly. And our final question for today comes from the line of Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.</p>\n    <p>Jim Schneider: Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. You know, relative to the strength of 2026 across leading-edge logic and DRAM, can we guess which one might grow stronger than the other and which one might surge whichever first?</p>\n    <p>Brice Hill: Sure, Jim. We think leading-edge will be the strongest grower with DRAM second, so that's our forecast.</p>\n    <p>Gary Dickerson: Yeah. One thing I say, Jim, I think both of them are gonna grow at a pretty strong rate. But it really in terms of we see the revenue depends on fab timing. So that's why we talked about kind of the second half of calendar '26, and those were the discussions I had with a lot of Asian customers when I was traveling and the dramatic improvement in visibility. So that also you have to take into consideration. Think about the timing of when those ramps will happen.</p>\n    <p>Jim Schneider: Thank you. Maybe as a quick follow-up, you have both margins expecting to increase in the back half once you get better absorption on costs. I understand that, are there any other underlying initiatives you're doing to improve gross margins operationally that could cause them further to improve?</p>\n    <p>Brice Hill: Sure. Thanks for the question. So on the gross margin side, if you look at 2025, up 120 basis points from 2024, the majority of that really has been improvements in our pricing processes, you know, change that we may be highlighted in previous calls, revamped our entire pricing program across the company. We're also working on cost reductions. The cost reductions, you know, were offset to some degree by tariff headwinds and by, you know, some of the inventory management, etcetera. So the real driver during the year was the price improvements. And those will continue as we go into '26.</p>\n    <p>So, you know, at the calendar second half, as we get more volume and you get some time for those to work, we should be able to improve the gross margins.</p>\n    <p>Jim Schneider: Thanks, Jim. And, Bryce, would you like to sign off for your call?</p>\n    <p>Brice Hill: Thanks, Mike. I'm excited that the investments we're making in leading-edge foundry logic, DRAM. I wish everyone a nice Thanksgiving, and I look forward to seeing many of you soon at the UBS Conference in Scottsdale. Mike, please close the call.</p>\n    <p>Mike Sullivan: Alright. Thank you. And I'd like to let everybody know that a replay of this call is gonna be available on the IR page of our website by 5 PM Pacific time today.</p>\n    <p>Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.</p>\n  </main>\n  <comments/>\n</doc>",

Applied Materials delivered fiscal fourth quarter results above the midpoint of our guidance to complete another record year. 2025 was our sixth consecutive year of growth, and over this period, we have grown revenue and earnings at annualized rates of approximately 12-20%. These results are made possible by our passionate and dedicated employees around the world. Over the past twelve months, we have built new capabilities, strengthened our product portfolio, and streamlined our organization to prepare for the opportunities ahead. Applied is in a tremendous position to benefit as AI computing fuels secular growth in semiconductors and wafer fab equipment.\nAs this is our year-end call, I'll begin with a brief review of our performance in 2025, then I'll provide our latest market outlook, and finally, I'll describe how our inflection-focused innovation strategy enables us to extend our leadership in the most valuable and fastest-growing areas of the market as next-generation technologies ramp in volume production in 2026 and beyond.\nLooking back at fiscal 2025, while it was a growth year for Applied, our growth rate was tempered due to increased trade restrictions and an unfavorable market mix. Over the past twelve months, multiple trade rule changes have reduced the size of our accessible market in China. Overall, China declined to 28% of our total systems and service revenues in fiscal 2025 and to 25% for our fourth quarter. In 2026, we expect wafer fab equipment spending in China to be lower, and we are not anticipating significant changes to market restrictions. In the areas of the market where we can operate, we are competing well and maintaining market share.\nOutside of China, the fastest-growing areas of the market in 2025 were segments where Applied had low or no share. In leading-edge foundry logic, investment was more oriented toward advanced lithography. We believe this is a positive leading indicator for process equipment demand in 2026. NAND, where historically Applied has lower market share, is on track to approximately double in 2025, even though it remains a relatively small portion of the wafer fab equipment market. In DRAM, where Applied has strong process technology leadership, overall spending is tracking to be approximately flat for calendar 2025. Nevertheless, we strengthened our leadership position in DRAM, growing revenues from leading-edge customers by more than 50% over the past four fiscal quarters.\nAs we look ahead to 2026, we expect the spending mix to play more to Applied's strengths with leading-edge foundry logic, DRAM, and advanced packaging being the fastest-growing areas of the market.\nI recently returned from an extended trip to Asia. My discussions with customers and partners reinforce my view that opportunities for the semiconductor industry and Applied Materials have never been greater. Our customers are engaging with us to ensure we are ready to support significant production ramps in the coming years. AI has reached a tipping point that is accelerating investment in next-generation computing infrastructure and advanced silicon. Today, we are seeing a virtuous cycle of innovation and demand advances in performance, energy consumption, and cost of AI computing open up new AI applications that in turn significantly increase demand for AI compute capacity. Recent third-party forecasts predict that the semiconductor industry will grow at a compound annual rate between 10 to 15% over the next five years, driving a healthy increase in wafer fab equipment spending. We expect 2026 to be another growth year for Applied, with our revenue being weighted toward the second half of the calendar year. AI computing is not only fueling growth but also reshaping the semiconductor roadmap and changing the way chips are designed and manufactured. Foundational semiconductor technology plays a critical role in increasing performance and bringing down the cost of AI in the data center and at the edge. Today, major technology inflections are underway in five key areas: leading-edge logic, high-performance DRAM, high-bandwidth memory or DRAM stacking, advanced packaging for heterogeneous integration, and power electronics. At Applied, our core strategy is inflection-focused innovation. We partner with our customers to see technology inflections early, we focus our research and development on the most critical and valuable challenges on their roadmaps using deep, co-innovation engagement models, and we create highly differentiated solutions by connecting our broad portfolio of capabilities and technologies.\nThe three products we recently launched at SEMICON West are great examples of how this strategy works. Our new Xterra epitaxy system enables higher performance gate-all-around transistors for two nanometers and beyond. Xterra creates void-free source drain structures that provide higher transistor speeds that are especially critical for AI computing. The Xterra system integrates Epi cleaning and etch, resulting in a 40% improvement in uniformity and 50% lower gas usage compared to traditional Epi. Connects is the industry's first integrated die-to-wafer bonder. Hybrid bonding enables significant improvement in performance, power consumption, and costs for both complex multichip packages and die stacking.\nConnects is a six-step integrated system with onboard metrology that provides higher accuracy bonding, smaller interconnect pitches, and higher yields for new logic and memory packaging architectures. ProVision 10 is designed to improve yield in 3D devices and further extends our leadership in e-beam metrology. E-beam metrology is critical for 3D devices as it can see through multiple layers of 3D chips and provide multilayer images to identify defects in buried structures. This system is the first to use cold field emission technology for metrology, which increases image resolution by 50% and imaging speed 10 times compared to conventional thermal field emission technology.\nOverall, Applied is very well positioned at the most valuable technology inflections and in areas of the market that will grow fastest as AI is deployed on a large scale. The process tool of record positions that we have established over the past several years give us confidence that we will extend our strong leadership position in logic, DRAM, and packaging as advanced technology nodes ramp in volume production. Another key theme we consistently hear from our customers and our customers' customers is that co-optimization of the technology stack is more critical than ever. We are expanding our deep multiyear co-innovation engagements that focus on system technology co-optimization.\nOur high-velocity co-innovation model provides chip makers and chip designers much earlier access to next-generation process technology to accelerate their new chip and system architectures. This is a core value proposition of Applied Materials' equipment and process innovation and commercialization platform, or EPIC. Construction of the platform's flagship facility, the Epic Center in Silicon Valley, is on track, and we are excited to begin operations next year. Our co-optimization strategies extend well beyond R&D. As our customers race to bring these complex new device architecture inflections to market, we are providing advanced service solutions that help them rapidly transfer new technology into their pilot lines and then rapidly optimize device performance, yield, and cost in volume production.\nIn 2025, our core service business delivered another year of double-digit growth, with more than two-thirds of our service revenue generated from subscriptions. In AGS and across Applied, we are rapidly adopting AI and digital tools. This enables us to drive higher velocity and productivity, innovate the way we work, and streamline our organization to meet the opportunities ahead.\nBefore I hand over to Brice, I'll quickly summarize. Fiscal 2025 was our sixth consecutive year of growth, even as trade restrictions and an unfavorable market mix trimmed our growth rate for the year. As we look ahead, large-scale AI adoption will drive substantial investment in AI computing infrastructure, including advanced semiconductors and wafer fab equipment. Applied's inflection-focused innovation strategy positions us for another record year in 2026 as we gain share at the highest value technology inflections in the fastest-growing areas of the market. As next-generation technologies ramp in volume production over the coming years, we will extend our leadership in logic, DRAM, and packaging. Brice, over to you.\nBrice Hill: Thank you, Gary. Thanks, everyone, for joining today's call. I am pleased that Applied delivered record annual revenue, gross margin dollars, operating profit, and earnings per share in fiscal 2025. Looking ahead into 2026, I believe we are in a great position to benefit from favorable market trends. Based on growing demand for AI data center capacity, we forecast that leading-edge foundry logic, DRAM, and high-bandwidth memory will be the fastest-growing areas of the semiconductor equipment market. We have strong leadership positions in these segments today, and we have targeted our R&D investments to create new products and technologies that will enable even faster and more energy-efficient transistors, chips, and systems, and drive growth for Applied.\nIn addition, we have been working closely with our customers to better understand their longer-term demand expectations and align our supply chain and manufacturing slots to meet their needs for advanced capacity. Based on our conversations with our customers and other industry players, we are preparing our operations and service organizations to be ready to support higher demand beginning in 2026.\nNext, I'll briefly summarize our fiscal 2025 results versus fiscal 2024. Revenue grew 4% to $28.4 billion, with growth across all of our segments. Semiconductor systems revenue was up 4%, growing even as the impact of trade restrictions significantly reduced our access to the market in China. The impact of these restrictions was equivalent to around 10% of the China market in fiscal 2024, and more than double that amount in fiscal 2025. On a global basis, we generated record foundry systems revenue along with record DRAM sales outside China. And we posted record revenue in both Taiwan and Korea. Applied Global Services revenue grew 3% to a record $6.4 billion.\nThe recurring parts, services, and software portion of AGS grew by double digits in the year, while the 200-millimeter equipment business declined. Display revenue grew by 20%. I am pleased that we increased non-GAAP gross margin by 120 basis points to 48.8%, the highest level in twenty-five years. We shipped a richer mix of advanced systems and increased prices broadly, helping to more than offset cost increases. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew 5%, primarily driven by a 10% increase in R&D investments. At the end of the year, we announced actions to reduce headcount and enable us to scale Applied more productively as we capture the growth opportunities we see in 2026 and beyond.\nWe continue to shift spending to strategic areas, adding people in fields like advanced analytics that are critical to the speed and efficiency of our R&D programs and operations. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased 9%. We generated nearly $8 billion in cash from operations. Free cash flow of $5.7 billion included elevated capital spending of $2.3 billion, over half of which was used in building the new Epic Center in Silicon Valley, which will open next year and become the most advanced, collaborative semiconductor equipment and process innovation facility in the world. We distributed approximately $6.3 billion to shareholders.\nWe paid $1.4 billion in cash dividends, and the quarterly dividend per share was increased by 15% during the year to 46¢. Operating income from Applied Global Services more than covered the dividend payment. We allocated $4.9 billion to our share repurchase program and reduced shares outstanding by more than 3%.\nTurning to fiscal Q4, we delivered revenue and non-GAAP EPS above the midpoint of guidance. China revenue declined to 29% of total company revenue, which is in line with our longer-term average and well below a peak of 45% in 2024. Non-GAAP gross margin was at the midpoint of guidance and up 60 basis points year on year, while non-GAAP operating expenses were slightly higher than our expectation and up 3% year on year. Turning to the segments, Semiconductor Systems and AGS revenue exceeded our expectations for the quarter, while non-GAAP operating margin for both segments declined along with revenue on a year-on-year basis. Lastly, Display revenue exceeded our expectation for the quarter and was up 68% year over year.\nNext, I'll share several reporting changes we are making that will help us drive further efficiency gains and also give investors more visibility into our semiconductor and services businesses. First, as of Q4 fiscal 2025, our display business is being reported in corporate and other. There is no change to our display strategy. Next, as of Q1 fiscal 2026, we are moving our 200-millimeter equipment business from Applied Global Services to Semiconductor Systems. This change will increase our operational efficiency and enable investors to see all of our semiconductor systems revenue in one place. Also, as a result, Applied Global Services will consist entirely of recurring revenue.\nThis will make it easier for investors to track our subscription-like growth and services. Finally, as of 2026, we are fully allocating corporate support costs to our businesses. This change will have the effect of reducing semiconductor systems and AGS operating margins, but also give our teams better visibility and opportunity to optimize these costs.\nNow I'll share our guidance for Q1, which includes the reporting changes I just outlined. We expect company revenue of $6.85 billion, plus or minus $500 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $2.18, plus or minus 20¢. Within this outlook, we expect semiconductor systems revenue of around $5.025 billion. AGS should generate revenue of around $1.52 billion. Corporate and other revenue should be around $305 million, composed primarily of display revenue. We currently expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 48.4% in Q1 and remain at that level until volumes ramp to support higher demand beginning in the second half of the calendar year.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses should be around $1.33 billion, which is up only slightly from fiscal Q4 because the actions we recently took are mostly offsetting the increase we normally see in Q1 due to the timing of annual merit increases and equity compensation expenses. Finally, we are modeling a tax rate of around 13%.\nIn summary, our customers are indicating to us that wafer fab equipment spending is likely to accelerate beginning in 2026. In addition, we see a positive fab equipment spending mix developing for Applied. AI data center investments translate to strong demand for our most enabling products in leading-edge foundry logic, DRAM, and high-bandwidth memory, along with advanced services that help our customers accelerate ramps and yields. Thank you for listening. Now, Mike, let's begin the Q&A.\nMike Sullivan: Thanks, Bryce. To help us reach as many people as we can on today's call, please ask just one question and no more than one brief follow-up question. Operator, let's please begin.\nOperator: Certainly. And our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.\nC.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Gary, the world has clearly changed since NVIDIA reported August 26 and discussed $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending. Curious, you know, given your trip to visit with clients, over the very near term, how your conversations have evolved in the last few months, how has your visibility changed, and how are you preparing your supply chain for this likely tremendous growth?\nGary Dickerson: Hi, C.J. Thanks for the question. Yeah. I have been spending a lot of time with customers and just came back from a long trip to Asia. And I would say, you know, I was meeting with the R&D leaders and CEOs of our largest customers, and just like you said, AI is the biggest focus for all of our customers. It's driving the WFE mix to segments driven by AI, leading-edge foundry logic, and DRAM where Applied has strong number one positions. And, you know, Applied is in deep high-velocity co-innovation relationships with all of these different customers. We have very high share.\nIf you look at the transistor for gate-all-around or backside power, in leading-edge foundry logic, we have very strong visibility and co-innovation relationships with customers over four technology nodes a decade out in the future. So very high visibility in terms of our position. In leading-edge foundry logic and in DRAM, and high confidence we're going to outperform as those advanced chips ramp going forward in the future. The other thing that I heard and we've been seeing over the last couple of months is a major improvement in customer demand visibility.\nCustomers, just like you said, they're planning large ramps of advanced factories and they want to make sure our supply chain operations and service teams are ready to deliver. So we're getting more than one year visibility, in some cases, two years visibility with a number of these different customers because as we talked about in the prepared remarks, in '26, we will see significant ramps for these advanced factories. And, again, customers want to make sure that, especially, our supply chains are ready to deliver. And, of course, the improved visibility is critical to our ability to ensure on-time delivery to customer needs. But I'd say that's, C.J., the biggest thing that's changed in the last couple of months.\nC.J. Muse: Very helpful. And then maybe, Bryce, you know, you announced the headcount reduction over the last quarter. I'm curious how we should think about that and the implications to gross margins and OpEx into the first half of calendar '26. Perhaps versus the second half given the ramp that you've talked about? Thank you.\nBrice Hill: Yeah. Thanks, C.J. Good to hear from you. So on the reduction, if you look at our Q1 spend in our guide, you'll see that we don't have the uplift that we typically have for our annual pay raises and the share-based compensation increases in Q1. Typically happen. So you'll be able to quantify the rough change in that quarter from that perspective. And just to highlight, you know, that was a years-long program that we worked on to increase velocity and productivity across the company. And for the balance of 2026, we'll add back some skills that we need to fill in for the company.\nSo it's really a wholesale evaluation of all the staffing models we have across the entire company.\nGary Dickerson: Yeah. C.J., maybe I'll add one another aspect to this. In strategic planning, we had a big focus on innovating the way we work, including AI and digital technologies. And driving, like Bryce said, higher velocity and productivity. That's really at the foundation of how companies compete. So huge focus, especially on velocity, across all of Applied Materials, and then streamlining our organization to optimize future performance. And as we went through these changes, we also wanted to make sure, as I talked about, we see significant demand coming from our customers.\nSo we wanted to make sure as we're doing this overall company and workforce optimization, to improve the performance of Applied, we're also ready to meet those major customer ramps in '26 and then going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Your question, please.\nKrish Sankar: Thanks for taking my question. Gary, my first question is, as you mentioned, you're clearly gaining share in new technologies like gate-all-around and backside power delivery. But when I look at your leadership product, it seems like PVD is moving to ALD. On the CVD, CMP, and etch side, besides the usual US and Japanese competitors, there's increasing domestic China competition. I'm kind of curious how to think about the momentum in those leadership products for the next two, three years as you see increasing competition both globally and from China. And then I have a follow-up for Bryce.\nGary Dickerson: Okay, Krish. There's a lot in that first question, but thank you for the question. So we have very strong positions, gate-all-around, and backside power. Besides being number one in process equipment for leading logic and foundry, we're also number one in DRAM and advanced packaging, especially for high-bandwidth memory. And those are the most important segments for AI energy-efficient computing, and leading-edge foundry, logic, and DRAM will be the fastest-growing segments in '26 and for the next several years. And, Krish, we're performing well across all our products. Again, I am extremely confident that we will grow share in these segments that are enabling AI energy-efficient computing.\nAgain, we have deep relationships with all of these different customers across multiple technology nodes, you know, we see strong demand for our products. Increasing demand for integrated systems for transistors, wiring, and now Connects for packaging. So all of that, I'm very optimistic about. And I'll come back to your PVD comment in just a minute here.\nThe biggest change we've seen in our competitive position in the near term is trade restrictions. We used to serve the entire global WFE market before restrictions were implemented. By 2024, we were restricted from serving around 10% of China's WFE market, mainly in leading-edge logic and the domestic NAND market. And then in the last month of 2024 and the first month of 2025, the restrictions significantly increased for us. And we could no longer serve China's DRAM market and some of the ICAPs market.\nSo our impact grew to well over 20% of the China WFE market, which I think everybody knows that the WFE market in China has been elevated this year and also over the past few years, with China approaching 40% of total WFE. So this change in restrictions was a very big impact, especially in 2025. And non-US equipment companies don't have the same restrictions. And so restricted customers can buy from those companies even if they would rather buy from Applied. And we've put a lot of time and studied this topic very carefully. And what we can see is that where we can compete, we are doing very well.\nAnd then if I look at China going forward, our business has returned to normalized levels. We talked about kind of mid-twenties on our semi-business, our systems in AGS. And looking ahead, we don't anticipate significant new restrictions. In fact, we believe that our share in China ICAPs where we can compete was flat from 2024 to 2025, and that's across Krish, all of our different leadership products. And we think we can continue to hold and have an opportunity to even gain share going forward. And I say this because we have several major ICAPs new products coming for China and non-China.\nThat add to the strong products we have today, enabling us to enter new ICAPS markets and also better compete in cost-sensitive areas of the market. So we will increase our ICAP's addressable market opportunity in China and worldwide. And, again, where we can compete, I'm actually very optimistic with our position.\nAnd then back to PVD, your question on PVD. So I'll tell you, Krish, PVD is doing great where we can compete. We grew PVD in '25. We have a positive outlook in '26 and into the future. And we talked, you know, talked earlier about AI. PVD is enabling low-resistance wiring, and that's critical for faster and more energy-efficient chips. And if with advanced chips, you have hundreds of miles of wiring in a single chip. And if you could imagine, you know, though that long wire keeps getting thinner and thinner, and moving data through that wire at high speed with low power is incredibly hard, almost like magic, and Applied is the clear leader in wiring innovation.\nSo Krish, we see strong demand for PVD. Strong growth in 2026 and into the future. We're also innovating. I talked about that pipeline of innovative products. We have new PVD innovations specifically for ICAPs beyond all of the other things that we're doing that will help us in performance in that particular segment. And then the last thing, you know, on the leading edge, we do have an increase in demand for the integrated products, including selective ALD and selective moly, which we just had some big wins in the most critical applications. So long answer, Krish.\nKrish Sankar: Thank you very much, Gary. No. It's extremely helpful and very informative. Thanks for that. Just a quick follow-up for Bryce. Bryce, how do you think about the impact of this 200-millimeter movement from AGS to semi? Is there a way to quantify it for Q1? Or how much was it in FY '25? Thank you.\nBrice Hill: It's approximately $125 million, Krish, for Q1 and approximately the same number in Q4. So, we're moving that from our services business to our equipment business. And we think that'll be easier for us to manage and easier for investors to understand those two different reportable segments.\nKrish Sankar: Thanks, Bryce. Thanks, Gary.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your question, please.\nVivek Arya: Thank you for taking the question. You mentioned you expect fiscal 2026 mix to work in your favor. You also mentioned the significant growth in the back half. I'm curious, do you think there is a potential for WFE to grow high single-digit, you know, close to double-digit next year and for Applied to outperform that? Because you do seem to have better visibility, and you also expect the mix to work in your favor. So I'm just hoping that if you could give us some sense of what the market, you know, could be doing and how is Applied positioned with respect to that market.\nBrice Hill: Hi, Vivek. It's Bryce. Thanks for your question. We do expect strong growth in '26 led by leading edge and DRAM. The headwind that we have, we do still expect some digestion in China and in ICAPs. So it's kind of a similar, you know, situation relative to 2025, but we think leading edge will be very strong. DRAM will be very strong. These are pulled by the, you know, headline of the AI solutions in those spaces. And then a little bit of digestion on the ICAP side, but we do think it will be a growth year.\nVivek Arya: Okay. On the, you know, clarification side, right, how much of the $600 million BIS headwind is in Q1 and the rest of the year? And if I could squeeze in the real question for Gary. One of your peers suggested an $8 billion or so, I think, WFE for every $100 billion or so in data center build-out. Do you agree with that number? Do you have a different number? And how do you see the mix within that $8 billion playing to Applied's strength? Thank you.\nBrice Hill: Okay, Vivek. So starting with the affiliate rule, that, you know, came out and affected our Q4 and then was suspended. So we had shared that $110 million would be affected in our Q4. We didn't ship that in Q4, but we will ship that in Q1. So the first answer is that's included in our guide for Q1. And then the $600 million is still a good estimate for what's in the rest of 2026. And, you know, we didn't share any linearity for that. And in fact, it's still being closed in terms of delivery dates, etcetera. So I would think of that as through the rest of the year.\nAnd then on the WFE per gigawatt, we spent some time thinking about this. We think the best way to think about this is about 15% of leading-edge wafer starts and DRAM wafer starts are allocated towards AI data center solutions. So if you think about capacity planning, that's growing at a mid-30s CAGR across the industry. So today, 15% of those two end markets growing at mid-thirties. And so for companies that are planning capacity for two and three years out, they make that projection, and that much WFE should be allocated towards data center.\nSo we can talk more about that in a follow-up, but I think that's a good way to think about how much is being allocated.\nGary Dickerson: Hi, Vivek. You asked about, you know, what does that mean, the AI demand mean for mix and, you know, for Applied. So I talked about this earlier that the two fastest-growing segments for '26 and going forward are leading-edge foundry logic and DRAM, including high-bandwidth memory. And in both of those cases, again, we're clear number one. We're gaining share, high visibility, and gate-all-around, and that'll become clear as those advanced factories ramp in the latter half of '26. Again, we have very strong visibility, very strong position. And the same thing is true with DRAM.\nAnd I think longer term, you know, if you look at gate-all-around backside power, we're positioned to capture more than 50% of our served market. So I have high confidence that we are gaining share and gate-all-around. I mean, that's all of the discussions I had with these R&D leaders when I was in Asia in the last month. And then DRAM high-bandwidth memory, we're in a really great position there. We've gained a significant amount of share over the last several years. As FinFET ramps, you know, we have strong leadership in FinFET. That's going to be adopted in DRAM four f squared. We're also in a great position.\nAnd then in HBM, future generations will adopt hybrid bonding where we also have clear leadership. We announced Connects at SEMICON West. So the mix is definitely working in our favor. And we're well-positioned going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question, please.\nStacy Rasgon: For the first one, Bryce, this second half lift in demand, so what does that imply for the trajectory in the first half? Like, are you thinking revenue stays kind of in this ballpark until we hit the second half, or does it grow a little bit and then it grows a lot? Maybe even if you wanted to quantify, like, second half versus first half split or something like that. But how do we think about the first half relative to the second half given the lift in the second?\nBrice Hill: Yeah. For the semi-business, Stacy, and thanks for the question. For the semi-business, we think it'll be flattish until we see that growth. We will see a little growth in the AGS business. We expect AGS to be growing at low double digits, and that's fairly continuous growth through the course of the year. For the semi-business in the short term, it'll be flattish. Until, like, Q3, I guess, you're thinking? Or, yeah. For us, it'll really be our Q4 and our Q1 of next year. So that's when the calendar, you know, that's when it matches the calendar. So we'll see a significant uplift there from leading edge, especially. And until then, you know, it'll be slower growth.\nStacy Rasgon: Okay. And I guess for my follow-up, you sort of mentioned gross margins kind of staying in this range until we see that lift. So do you expect a material lift in gross margins when that material lift in revenue comes through? Or like how do we expect, like, the gross margin trajectory on the back of those revenues as that comes through?\nBrice Hill: The 48.4% guide for Q1 is good for this level of business, and I'll just highlight in Q1, we're also expecting a normal share from a China shipment perspective. So it should be for the whole company, it should be in the order of 29% and less than that for AGS and our semi-business. So that level, you know, without a significant uplift in the business, that's good for this size business. And then when we do get to the second half, added volume will help with cost improvements. And then over time, we continue to work on our pricing and cost programs.\nSo you can see with the 120 basis point uplift that we had in 2025, most of that was driven by price improvement. So we'll continue with that program, but it takes time to, you know, to affect the margins.\nGary Dickerson: Stacy, this is Gary. One thing I'd say in terms of margins, I do think that we will be able to drive sustainable improvements in margins over time. I mean, one thing in the industry, you see a tremendous amount of profits being generated with the AI demand throughout the entire ecosystem. And so our customers' profitability has improved significantly. And as I mentioned earlier, also, we're enabling these incredible innovations. I mentioned the hundreds of miles of wiring in an advanced chip. I mean, again, for AI, this is incredibly valuable.\nSo as we continue to work with our customers enabling those innovations that are critical for AI, bringing new products to market, you know, I believe that we can sustainably drive our margins higher going forward.\nStacy Rasgon: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Bryce, I'm trying to understand China a little better. So all these affiliates were banned, and then they got reinstated. And the way that China usually operates is that when they were rushing to get in front of the ban, and now I would think that they're gonna come back, and they're gonna just try to get as much equipment as they can as fast as they can. So is the add-back not gonna be more than $600 million, and in fiscal Q1, like, are you taking slots away from other customers to give to them?\nI guess I'm trying to figure out how we don't add more than $600 million back the way that these, you know, Chinese customers typically operate.\nBrice Hill: Thanks for the question, Tim. So, yeah, for the first quarter, $110 million is in the quarter. Those tools are built and will ship. For the balance, we weren't building those tools. You know, we didn't know we would be able to ship them, and so it's going to take time to do the supply chain and actually make the builds, and we'll have to finalize the date with the customers. So they may have interest in working that process as quickly as possible, but I would just say the good way to think about this is cycle time, and we'll spread it through the year.\nTimothy Arcuri: Okay. And then, I guess, Gary, I want to go back to PVD. So this is about 30% or so. I mean, for Gartner, so it's a super important piece of your business. And it does seem a little bit like ALD is eating into this franchise a little bit. You know, I know it's super important. It's been growing, but how do you sort of protect that franchise from, you know, you have one franchise you're very strong in and then one where your share is not high. Do you think that we're all kind of with, our new leaders for our top customers? And, you know, we have deep visibility into their technology roadmap for four generations.\nAnd I can tell you, again, we have high confidence. PVD is gonna continue to ramp. I mentioned a hundred miles of wiring in an advanced chip. And, you know, we have innovations, really amazing innovations, and we are the leader in wiring. So if you think about an AI server, again, how you move the data at a very high speed with low power is enormously important. That's within a chip, chip to chip. There's so much innovation that's happening. But I don't know where this comes from on the ALD eating PVD share, that type of thing. All I can say is that we have extremely high visibility. We have unique technologies, including PVD.\nWe have a unique ability to combine technologies and integrated platforms. One of those integrated platforms, we combined selective ALD together with PVD and five other technologies. That's part of what's enabling those hundreds of miles of wiring. Applied is really unique in being able to deliver those kinds of innovations. And that is enabling a 50% improvement in resistivity. It's a billion-dollar business for us every year. And so, you know, that is going to continue. Again, deep visibility into every input one, input two, input three, input four technology nodes. Another innovation that we just won with leading-edge logic companies is integrating selective Moly with PVD into an integrated platform for the most critical applications for our customers.\nSo, again, Tim, very high visibility, with you. It's a great business. It's gonna keep growing in '26 and keep growing as we go forward.\nTimothy Arcuri: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Adam Mullen from Citi. Your question, please.\nAdam Mullen: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions, welcome back, Mike. Bryce, I understand that the China commentary you're expecting China to kind of stay at the mid-twenties level for the silicon products into next year. The assumption is that domestic China spending is coming down next year. You know, why would it be lower than the mid-5% and especially China is growing? I'm trying to understand the moving pieces.\nBrice Hill: Yes. Thank you, Adam. Yeah. So for Q1, that just happens to be what's in the mix. But we do expect it, you know, if we do have the digestion that we're expecting in China, then we will see it lower during the course of the year. And they'll be more than offset, you know, to get growth here, they'll be more than offset by the strength in Leading Edge and DRAM that we highlighted earlier. So and, you know, we'll just admit. I think we've been wrong for two years in a row. Forecasting a digestion related to China, and it's stronger each year. We could be surprised on the upside, you know, as we go through.\nBut right now, Gary mentioned this a few minutes ago. China, you know, has almost been almost 40% of WFE. It's been elevated. They've been investing heavily to get to, you know, sustain self-sustainability from a production perspective. So it's, you know, we don't have as good of visibility because of a large number of customers there and the continuing creation of new customers. So it's not as easy to forecast as, you know, the rest of the mature market.\nGary Dickerson: I have one thing I say also, longer term, what we think is that ICAPs remains about one-third of WFE, and then you have, you know, memory and leading-edge foundry logic. So China is really mostly an ICAPs market, and there has been a delta spending over multiple years. We think that if you just look at end market demand, you know, we think that moves back into that ZIP code over a longer period of time. And when that happens, it's hard to anticipate exactly when that's going to happen, but that's when we think over a longer period.\nAdam Mullen: Great. And then, Gary, one for you. You visited several customers. You know, are your memory customers constrained by shell capacity? And why are you talking about the second half? Inflection of the first half? I mean, I understand the fact that it's being dragged lower by China, but is there a situation where the memory guy is constrained by shell capacity?\nBrice Hill: Well, I can take the question, Adam. So first, I would say that factory schedules, of course, matter. So each company, each customer has their own schedule for, you know, installation and ramp, the qualification, and the like. Our information on a macro level, we had several people ask this question, our information on a macro level suggests that there is, you know, factory capacity from a space perspective to ramp across the industry. And then you'll just have to ask each customer. That's a macro answer. You'll have to ask each customer for their situation. We don't think the capacity is limiting the ramp at this point.\nAdam Mullen: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Charles Shi from Needham. Can I get your question, please?\nCharles Shi: Thanks for taking my question. I have a follow-up on China. You did mention outside of restrictions, you are not losing share. But your European peer, the closest one, reported much stronger China revenue growth this year. I think they're probably growing at 100% year-on-year. You're probably declining more than 10% year-on-year. So just really trying to reconcile how you're losing share. Yeah. Either users that would make anything and that would suggest you actually did not lose share in China? Despite the numbers we suggest otherwise. Thank you.\nBrice Hill: Hi, Charles. I'll start on this one. So I think the nuance, you know, we clarified that. We made an adjustment in there and said, if we look at the accounts that we can support, we're holding our share and competing well in China. And just take the macro number, we certainly lost share in China. I think Gary commented if you go back to 2024, just over 10% of the market was restricted for US companies. If you go to 2025, it's more than doubled. The restriction has more than doubled. So we certainly lost share in China because a larger portion of the market is inaccessible to us.\nBut when we look at the accounts that we can sell to, we feel we're competing very well.\nGary Dickerson: Yeah. Charles, it's Gary. I think we have done a lot of work on this. So and there's a lot of different sources of data that can cross-validate the numbers. And, again, we look at we can't comment on other people. You know? Their ability to serve global customers in China versus domestic customers. You know, everybody's gonna have a little difference in terms of what, you know, what they're serving in China. Certainly for us, NAND, the global NAND in China, is not a significant business. DRAM, however, really was restricted at the, you know, at the beginning of our fiscal year, we have very high share in DRAM.\nIf you look at the top the leading DRAM companies, last year, I think our business was up something like 50%. And so for Applied, DRAM going away had a really big impact on us. So again, Charles, I think we have pretty good confidence maintaining share where we can compete. It will be a different mix for every company.\nBrice Hill: Like if you want anything.\nCharles Shi: No. I think that covers it. Yeah. The only other thing I would add to that, Charles, the other part of that is not only the DRAM, but it's NAND. So if you think about what was shipping? You have multinational NAND companies that are in China. And they were, you know, presumably pretty strong. And as you may know that in our mix, that's the lowest area for us. So Gary talked about the DRAM impact. The other impact is NAND strong. And both of them in that equation, in the future, on a global basis, we think is changing.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.\nJoe Quatrochi: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could help us understand what was the size of the impacting business in fiscal 2025 and how did that grow?\nBrice Hill: Hi, Joe. It's Bryce. It's a little bit lower than it was in 2024. So 2024 was buoyed by, you know, the shipments, the high shipments at the end of the year for HBM. So essentially, it's been running at the same level for 2025. Minus, you know, that shipments at the end of that year. So and then as we look forward, you know, Gary is, like, going to comment about the technologies for advanced packaging over time. We think we're well-positioned for that. We still think that business will be growing significantly along with the AI data center and all the different packaging capabilities that will be required over time.\nGary Dickerson: Yeah. Joe, so Applied is number one in high-bandwidth memory. So that doesn't not as strong as '25 as it was the previous year. So that was one thing that, you know, impacted our relative growth rate. But, you know, it's pretty close to flat year over year. '25 versus '24, the HBM coming down. Versus where it was. What I'm saying is that we're still on track to what we discussed before. We've grown the business around $500 million to about $1.5 billion today. And we're on track still to double this business to $3 billion or more over the next few years. And I think we're really in a very good position.\nLike I said earlier, we're number one in HBM, so as HBM ramps over time, that puts us in a good position. We have a great portfolio of products. And especially, this is I mentioned the trip in Asia and meeting with a lot of these R&D leaders. There's an enormous focus for our customers to go to larger packaging sizes so they can connect more GPUs, CPUs, and all these different computing components to improve performance and power an enormous amount. And so Applied is extremely well-positioned in HBM, and we're also well-positioned as these technologies ramp in the future. So I think high confidence in being able to double this business again over the next few years.\nJoe Quatrochi: That's helpful detail. Maybe the follow-up on the China entity. With $600 million that then it comes back here. Any help on what the split of that was for, like, AGS in terms of service, I assume that would be basically just kind of turn right back getting your able to service the customers?\nBrice Hill: Yeah. You're right. There was some AGS in that. We didn't offer that. I don't have it at my fingertips. So, there was a component of AGS. But I think the majority was equipment.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Shane Brett from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\nShane Brett: Thank you for letting me ask the question. The first question is, you mentioned that your revenue from leading-edge customers grew 50% in 2025.\nBrice Hill: Yeah. I'll start, Shane. So, you know, when you do the year-over-year comparison, it looks flat for us from a DRAM perspective, but what was happening in 2020 we shipped a significant amount of business to China customers. And so we basically have the same business in 2025 without the China customers. So all of that business went to the internationals, and that equated to approximately 50% growth for them. And we do expect, you know, DRAM to strengthen as we go into '26. It should be healthy growth across the customers for DRAM investments.\nGary Dickerson: Yeah. So in terms of, you know, where are we gaining? Certainly, I mentioned earlier high-bandwidth memory. That's one part that, you know, one segment where Applied is clear number one, and that is helping us. DRAM companies are driving innovation. In IO. Applied really leverages a lot of our leadership products and foundry logic. In fact, they're moving to FinFET going forward. That puts Applied in a good position. Even to gain more shares, go forward. We have a strong position in capacitor scaling. We have a really strong etch share in DRAM, and we've achieved patterning share gains. Those are a few areas.\nAgain, I would say going forward, as these DRAM companies adopt hybrid bonding for HBM, as they adopt FinFET, as they adopt four f squared, the vertical channel transistor architecture, and all of those areas we're positioned to gain share as those new technologies ramp.\nShane Brett: Got it. Thank you. And the second question may be a little bit critical, but your fiscal 2025 foundry logic revenue is up about 3% year over year, your US peers should be on the level playing field with that. Why can't you outperform in '26? Thank you.\nGary Dickerson: So foundry logic includes both leading-edge and, you know, ICAP's customers. So, you know, those two things are mixed together. You look, we had record revenue in Taiwan, record revenue in Korea. And so, you know, our performance is extremely strong in the leading edge. Revenue was up a significant amount. So you have all those things kind of mixed together. I think, in those in that data and because everybody's combining that.\nShane Brett: Thanks, Shane. I'll help you rest on for one more question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. And our final question for today comes from the line of Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.\nJim Schneider: Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. You know, relative to the strength of 2026 across leading-edge logic and DRAM, can we guess which one might grow stronger than the other and which one might surge whichever first?\nBrice Hill: Sure, Jim. We think leading-edge will be the strongest grower with DRAM second, so that's our forecast.\nGary Dickerson: Yeah. One thing I say, Jim, I think both of them are gonna grow at a pretty strong rate. But it really in terms of we see the revenue depends on fab timing. So that's why we talked about kind of the second half of calendar '26, and those were the discussions I had with a lot of Asian customers when I was traveling and the dramatic improvement in visibility. So that also you have to take into consideration. Think about the timing of when those ramps will happen.\nJim Schneider: Thank you. Maybe as a quick follow-up, you have both margins expecting to increase in the back half once you get better absorption on costs. I understand that, are there any other underlying initiatives you're doing to improve gross margins operationally that could cause them further to improve?\nBrice Hill: Sure. Thanks for the question. So on the gross margin side, if you look at 2025, up 120 basis points from 2024, the majority of that really has been improvements in our pricing processes, you know, change that we may be highlighted in previous calls, revamped our entire pricing program across the company. We're also working on cost reductions. The cost reductions, you know, were offset to some degree by tariff headwinds and by, you know, some of the inventory management, etcetera. So the real driver during the year was the price improvements. And those will continue as we go into '26.\nSo, you know, at the calendar second half, as we get more volume and you get some time for those to work, we should be able to improve the gross margins.\nJim Schneider: Thanks, Jim. And, Bryce, would you like to sign off for your call?\nBrice Hill: Thanks, Mike. I'm excited that the investments we're making in leading-edge foundry logic, DRAM. I wish everyone a nice Thanksgiving, and I look forward to seeing many of you soon at the UBS Conference in Scottsdale. Mike, please close the call.\nMike Sullivan: Alright. Thank you. And I'd like to let everybody know that a replay of this call is gonna be available on the IR page of our website by 5 PM Pacific time today.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

The business has two core parts: Mobile, which brings in about 67% of 2025's revenue and relies heavily on Apple iPhones and top-tier Androids, and Broad Markets, the other 33%, covering areas like automotive connectivity, Wi-Fi 7, edge IoT, data centers, and industrial gear. They make most of their chips in-house but also work with third-party foundries when needed. Like the rest of the chip world, Skyworks faces stiff competition and industry ups and downs. Its main rivals? Qorvo, Broadcom, and Qualcomm, all battling for a slice of the radio-frequency (RF) and mixed-signal market. Skyworks has an edge thanks to deep client ties—Apple alone delivered about 63% of revenue in Q3 2025—and a diverse product line reaching beyond mobile. Recently, the company’s broadened its Broad Markets push and announced a merger with Qorvo, a $22 billion bet meant to bring scale, boost R&amp;D, and help weather industry cycles.</p>\n    <p>In the 12 months through November 13, 2025, Skyworks shares lost 20.2%, lagging well behind the S&amp;P 500’s 14.43% gain. That rough patch tracks with a broader chip downturn thanks to customers slimming down their inventories, slower handset sales as the world adjusts to 5G, and weaker demand for car chips amid sluggish electric vehicle sales. On top of that, increased competition for Apple’s business has dimmed expectations for future mobile revenue.</p>\n    <p>Growth Prospects</p>\n    <p>Skyworks pulled in $4.087 billion in fiscal 2025 revenue—a 2.2% dip from last year’s $4.178 billion—as both mobile and automotive markets worked through leftover inventory. Management expects Q1 2026 revenue between $975 million and $1.025 billion, bracing for typical post-holiday mobile declines but seeing mid- to high-single-digit growth in areas like Wi-Fi 7, car connectivity, and edge IoT within Broad Markets. Looking further ahead, more complex RF chips will be needed as AI boosts data traffic and 6G starts rolling out—potential growth drivers for Skyworks.</p>\n    <p>Quality &amp; Moat</p>\n    <p>The company is reliably cash-generative, posting $1.11 billion in free cash flow in 2025, which means a healthy free cash flow yield of 7.39% (five-year average: 5.13%; market average: 1.99%). But profitability has taken a hit. Their non-GAAP operating margin is down to 13.55%—well off the five-year average of 22.56% and under the market’s 18.25%. That squeeze comes from heavy R&amp;D and tough pricing. Return on invested capital is also below par at 8.10% (trailing both the five-year average of 14.97% and the market’s 11.14%). The company’s close ties with Apple are a competitive advantage, but they also make Skyworks vulnerable, since 63% of revenue flows in from Cupertino. On the bright side, management is putting its money where its mouth is, buying back $830 million worth of shares this year.</p>\n    <p>Valuation</p>\n    <p>Skyworks currently trades at a forward P/E (Price-to-earnings ratio) of 23.99x, which is a bit of a discount to the market average of 26.49x. Its EV/Sales (Enterprise Value to Sales) stands at 2.70x, below both its own five-year average of 3.45x and the market’s 4.56x. That discounted value reflects the challenges Skyworks faces right now—but if demand for AI and 5G chips heats up, and those slim margins start to recover, the shares could re-rate quickly.</p>\n    <p>Market Sentiment</p>\n    <p>Skyworks shares are trading 9.37% below their 50-day average, a sign of current weakness. Short sellers have become more active, with short interest at 7.16% of float and a 4.3-day cover ratio—both up over the last month, pointing to a more bearish crowd. Still, institutions hold around 85% of shares, showing that big investors remain committed. Analyst sentiment is lukewarm: 5 say Buy, 14 say Hold, 3 advise Sell. Meanwhile, the stock yields a 3.04% dividend with a high payout ratio of 75.7%.</p>\n    <p>Skyworks is trading at a discount to both its own history and broader semiconductor peers. Its healthy free cash flow and early efforts to branch out into Broad Markets are promising. But there are still big, near-term clouds: losing share within mobile, weaker end-markets, and shrinking margins all add risk. If you’re planning to stick around for the long haul and believe in the growth story for 5G, 6G, edge IoT, and AI-fueled demand, Skyworks could be appealing—provided you keep an eye on how well they pull off the Qorvo merger and how their key segments perform.

The business has two core parts: Mobile, which brings in about 67% of 2025's revenue and relies heavily on Apple iPhones and top-tier Androids, and Broad Markets, the other 33%, covering areas like automotive connectivity, Wi-Fi 7, edge IoT, data centers, and industrial gear. They make most of their chips in-house but also work with third-party foundries when needed. Like the rest of the chip world, Skyworks faces stiff competition and industry ups and downs. Its main rivals? Qorvo, Broadcom, and Qualcomm, all battling for a slice of the radio-frequency (RF) and mixed-signal market. Skyworks has an edge thanks to deep client ties—Apple alone delivered about 63% of revenue in Q3 2025—and a diverse product line reaching beyond mobile. Recently, the company’s broadened its Broad Markets push and announced a merger with Qorvo, a $22 billion bet meant to bring scale, boost R&D, and help weather industry cycles.\nIn the 12 months through November 13, 2025, Skyworks shares lost 20.2%, lagging well behind the S&P 500’s 14.43% gain. That rough patch tracks with a broader chip downturn thanks to customers slimming down their inventories, slower handset sales as the world adjusts to 5G, and weaker demand for car chips amid sluggish electric vehicle sales. On top of that, increased competition for Apple’s business has dimmed expectations for future mobile revenue.\nGrowth Prospects\nSkyworks pulled in $4.087 billion in fiscal 2025 revenue—a 2.2% dip from last year’s $4.178 billion—as both mobile and automotive markets worked through leftover inventory. Management expects Q1 2026 revenue between $975 million and $1.025 billion, bracing for typical post-holiday mobile declines but seeing mid- to high-single-digit growth in areas like Wi-Fi 7, car connectivity, and edge IoT within Broad Markets. Looking further ahead, more complex RF chips will be needed as AI boosts data traffic and 6G starts rolling out—potential growth drivers for Skyworks.\nQuality & Moat\nThe company is reliably cash-generative, posting $1.11 billion in free cash flow in 2025, which means a healthy free cash flow yield of 7.39% (five-year average: 5.13%; market average: 1.99%). But profitability has taken a hit. Their non-GAAP operating margin is down to 13.55%—well off the five-year average of 22.56% and under the market’s 18.25%. That squeeze comes from heavy R&D and tough pricing. Return on invested capital is also below par at 8.10% (trailing both the five-year average of 14.97% and the market’s 11.14%). The company’s close ties with Apple are a competitive advantage, but they also make Skyworks vulnerable, since 63% of revenue flows in from Cupertino. On the bright side, management is putting its money where its mouth is, buying back $830 million worth of shares this year.\nValuation\nSkyworks currently trades at a forward P/E (Price-to-earnings ratio) of 23.99x, which is a bit of a discount to the market average of 26.49x. Its EV/Sales (Enterprise Value to Sales) stands at 2.70x, below both its own five-year average of 3.45x and the market’s 4.56x. That discounted value reflects the challenges Skyworks faces right now—but if demand for AI and 5G chips heats up, and those slim margins start to recover, the shares could re-rate quickly.\nMarket Sentiment\nSkyworks shares are trading 9.37% below their 50-day average, a sign of current weakness. Short sellers have become more active, with short interest at 7.16% of float and a 4.3-day cover ratio—both up over the last month, pointing to a more bearish crowd. Still, institutions hold around 85% of shares, showing that big investors remain committed. Analyst sentiment is lukewarm: 5 say Buy, 14 say Hold, 3 advise Sell. Meanwhile, the stock yields a 3.04% dividend with a high payout ratio of 75.7%.\nSkyworks is trading at a discount to both its own history and broader semiconductor peers. Its healthy free cash flow and early efforts to branch out into Broad Markets are promising. But there are still big, near-term clouds: losing share within mobile, weaker end-markets, and shrinking margins all add risk. If you’re planning to stick around for the long haul and believe in the growth story for 5G, 6G, edge IoT, and AI-fueled demand, Skyworks could be appealing—provided you keep an eye on how well they pull off the Qorvo merger and how their key segments perform. Investors should weigh the value argument against the real operational and execution risks before jumping in or adding more to an existing stake.\n| Help us improve Stock Snapshots — share your feedback.\nMentioned in story\nDid you find this insightful?\nNope\nSort of\nAbsolutely\nDisclaimer: These articles are provided for information purposes only.

      "content": "<doc fingerprint=\"2c08f91c07f6ec2f\">\n  <main>\n    <p>Applied Materials (AMAT, Financial) experienced a rebound today, trading near unchanged after releasing its Q4 results. The company exceeded expectations for both revenue and earnings per share (EPS), although EPS fell 6% year-over-year (yr/yr) and revenue decreased by 3.5% to $6.8 billion. This marks AMAT's first yr/yr EPS decline since July 2023 and its first revenue drop in seven quarters, largely due to decreased demand from China and slightly increased operating expenses. The midpoint of its Q1 guidance suggests further yr/yr declines, with $2.18 EPS on $6.85 billion in revenue.</p>\n    <list rend=\"ul\">\n      <item>Positive indicators were noted in leading-edge foundry/logic, DRAM, and HBM sectors, aligning with AMAT's strong market positions.</item>\n      <item>NAND spending is projected to double by CY25, although AMAT has historically held a lower market share in this area.</item>\n      <item>Revenue from China dropped to 29%, down from a 45% peak in Q1 FY24, due to expanded export restrictions and reduced demand in ICAPS-related markets. However, revenue in Taiwan increased by 42% yr/yr, making up about 27% of total revenue.</item>\n      <item>Semiconductor Systems revenue fell 8% yr/yr to $4.76 billion, slightly better than expected. The mix was led by foundry and logic at 65%, followed by DRAM at 29%, though operating margin decreased to 32.1% from 35.2%.</item>\n      <item>Management noted improved customer visibility, with some planning one to two years ahead.

      "text_content": "Applied Materials (AMAT, Financial) experienced a rebound today, trading near unchanged after releasing its Q4 results. The company exceeded expectations for both revenue and earnings per share (EPS), although EPS fell 6% year-over-year (yr/yr) and revenue decreased by 3.5% to $6.8 billion. This marks AMAT's first yr/yr EPS decline since July 2023 and its first revenue drop in seven quarters, largely due to decreased demand from China and slightly increased operating expenses. The midpoint of its Q1 guidance suggests further yr/yr declines, with $2.18 EPS on $6.85 billion in revenue.\n- Positive indicators were noted in leading-edge foundry/logic, DRAM, and HBM sectors, aligning with AMAT's strong market positions.\n- NAND spending is projected to double by CY25, although AMAT has historically held a lower market share in this area.\n- Revenue from China dropped to 29%, down from a 45% peak in Q1 FY24, due to expanded export restrictions and reduced demand in ICAPS-related markets. However, revenue in Taiwan increased by 42% yr/yr, making up about 27% of total revenue.\n- Semiconductor Systems revenue fell 8% yr/yr to $4.76 billion, slightly better than expected. The mix was led by foundry and logic at 65%, followed by DRAM at 29%, though operating margin decreased to 32.1% from 35.2%.\n- Management noted improved customer visibility, with some planning one to two years ahead. A flattish first half of CY26 is expected, with significant growth in 2H26 as leading-edge logic, DRAM, and HBM tied to AI data-center demand accelerate.\nAMAT's Q4 results surpassed expectations, but the yr/yr declines in revenue and EPS, primarily due to challenges in China, continue to affect sentiment.

執行長趙海軍在財報的電話會議上說，客戶不敢對明年第一季下太多訂單，因為沒有人知道會有多少記憶體晶片可以用來支持手機、汽車和其它產品。 他表示，使用記憶體的汽車和智慧手機製造商，明年將面臨(記憶體)價格壓力和供應的不確定性。他補充說，目前沒有人給出明確的供應承諾。 分析師表示，由於全球企業紛紛轉而生產用於人工智慧的半導體產品，導致用於智慧型手機、電腦和伺服器的記憶體晶片供應趨於吃緊，進而引發部分客戶的恐慌性搶購，並導致價格飆升。 執行長說，目前記憶體市場供不應求，價格已經大幅飆升。 趙海軍警告說，記憶體產業的「超級循環」，也加劇了晶圓代工廠的競爭，因為客戶希望透過談判，壓低其它類型IC的合約價格，來抵銷記憶體晶片上漲的壓力。 中芯同時公布財報，得益於本地市場強勁需求，第三季營收年增9.7%，為23.8億美元，獲利增加28.9%，來到1.92億美元，兩者都高於分析師預期。 中芯第三季的月度產能為季增3.2%，達到102萬片的(相當)8吋晶圓。產能利用率從第二</p>時報資訊 ・ 1 天前<head rend=\"h3\">中芯國際警告：記憶體大缺貨 衝擊明年汽車與手機生產</head><p>中芯國際

中芯財報顯示，第三季營收人民幣（下同）171.62億元，季增6.9％，年增9.9％。累計前三季營收495.1億元，年增18.2％。淨利15.17億元，年增43.1％，累計前三季淨利38.18億元，年增41.1％。財報指出，利潤增長主要是由於晶圓銷量年增及產品組合變動所致。 毛利率方面，第三季為25.5％，較上季大幅提升4.8個百分點，前三季毛利率23.2％，較上年同期增加5.6個百分點。

從下游業者回應來看，記憶體缺貨與價格波動對品牌廠與ODM組裝廠的影響呈現差異。由於記憶體多由品牌廠主導採購，ODM廠的成本端並未直接暴露在價格壓力下，因此實際影響相對有限。

中芯：恐衝擊明年汽車、手機業\n【時報-台北電】大陸晶圓代工龍頭中芯國際聯合首席執行長趙海軍14日表示，2025年第四季「淡季不淡」，當前產能仍供不應求，預計全年收入將首次突破90億美元。他並示警，記憶體短缺恐衝擊2026年的汽車、智慧型手機和消費電子產品等行業。\n綜合陸媒報導，中芯國際13日公布財報顯示，第三季銷售總額23.82億美元，年增9.7％，季增7.8％。第三季折合8吋標準邏輯月產能增至102.3萬片，產能利用率達到95.8％，出貨量繼續提升。以地區分類來看，中國、美國、歐亞市場占比分別為86.2％、10.8％和3％。\n展望第四季，趙海軍於14日舉行的業績說明會上釋出積極訊號，他表示，第四季為行業淡季，客戶備貨有所放緩，但產業鏈迭代效應持續，公司產線仍處於供不應求狀態。\n對於當前製造商對儲存晶片的囤積導致供應緊張，價格大幅上漲，趙海軍表示，AI促使業內的大供應商放棄了少量多樣的碎片化市場，這給了小供應商，以及處於其上游的中芯國際非常大的機會。只要AI還在發展，記憶體的價格會持續很多年。\n但是，趙海軍警告，當前行業內記憶體價格上漲非常多，記憶體大週期將對終端生產廠商帶來負面影響。無論是汽車、手機還是消費電子類產品，終端廠商明年都將感受到記憶體的價格壓力和供應保障問題。此外，記憶晶片擠壓客戶的整體物料成本，使得設備內其他晶片的代工價格競爭更加激烈。\n他指出，由於不確定能否獲得足夠的記憶體供應，大陸企業對2026年初向中芯國際下訂單時變得更加謹慎。「現在企業多拿一點記憶體，能趕快做成手機，但是對明年第一季大家就不做決定，因為第一季不能保證自己能有足夠的記憶體做成整機，現在大家都看不清狀況，沒有人能對明年需求百分之百保證。」(新聞來源

他表示，使用記憶體的汽車和智慧手機製造商，明年將面臨(記憶體)價格壓力和供應的不確定性。他補充說，目前沒有人給出明確的供應承諾。 分析師表示，由於全球企業紛紛轉而生產用於人工智慧的半導體產品，導致用於智慧型手機、電腦和伺服器的記憶體晶片供應趨於吃緊，進而引發部分客戶的恐慌性搶購，並導致價格飆升。 執行長說，目前記憶體市場供不應求，價格已經大幅飆升。 趙海軍警告說，記憶體產業的「超級循環」，也加劇了晶圓代工廠的競爭，因為客戶希望透過談判，壓低其它類型IC的合約價格，來抵銷記憶體晶片上漲的壓力。 中芯同時公布財報，得益於本地市場強勁需求，第三季營收年增9.7%，為23.8億美元，獲利增加28.9%，來到1.92億美元，兩者都高於分析師預期。 中芯第三季的月度產能為季增3.2%，達到102萬片的(相當)8吋晶圓。產能利用率從第二\n時報資訊 ・ 1

天前美管制讓先進晶片太缺、傳北京出手分配中芯產能\nMoneyDJ新聞 2025-11-12 13:48:52 郭妍希 發佈市場傳出，美國晶片管制導致先進半導體過於短缺，迫使中國政府出手干涉中芯國際(SMIC)的產能分配。 華爾街日報11日引述未具名消息人士報導，北京當局試圖把中芯產能優先供應科技集團及國家隊華為(Huawei Technologies)。其中，華為主要是運用中芯技術打造AI晶片。中國科技業者正在爭奪有限的國內產能，在某些案例中，實驗室甚至會以走私的方式取得輝達(Nvidia Corp.)的高性能晶片。 消息人士透露，知名AI新創DeepSeek因為晶片短缺的關係，今(2025)年稍早曾被迫推遲最新AI模型的發表時程。華為等業者已開始另闢蹊徑，例如把數千顆晶片綑綁成一個龐大且耗電的系統，協助訓練AI模型。 為了化解美國出口管制的衝擊，中國企業與北京當局採取了極端手段，凸顯AI爭霸的重要性。 輝達執行長黃仁勳(Jensen Huang) 11月6日透過社交平台X的官方帳號表示，「我很早以前就曾說過，中國AI產業只差幾奈秒(nanoseconds)就可追上美國。」「最重要的是，美國必須加速衝刺、並贏得全球開發者的支持，才能獲\nMoneydj理財網 ・ 3 天前《半導體》記憶體添力 南茂續拉漲停、1年半高價\n【時報記者葉時安台北報導】南茂(8150)今年第三季業績超標，第四季展望正向，且南茂可望為記憶體超級循環Supercycle的受惠者，對後續營運展望亦轉為正向，本土法人調升南茂投資評等至買進，並上修目標價，周三外資大幅買超，自營商亦連三天力挺，南茂周四股價強攻至44元漲停，連續兩天高鎖漲停，創近一年半以來高價。 南茂今年第三季毛利率強升至12.4%，主因產品組合、記憶體封測需求、產能利用率，單季EPS為0.50元，遠高於市場預估。展望今年第四季，南茂仍預期記憶體將是關鍵成長驅動力，相關服務的產能利用率將持續提升。南茂認為DDR4和DDR5需求持續強勁，而NAND Flash動能將因庫存調整而略微放緩。另一方面，顯示器驅動IC將維持疲軟，因終端需求仍然偏弱。然而，車用面板及美系智慧型手機品牌的OLED需求依然強勁。在混合信號方面，公司亦將擴展其業務至DDR5模組的PMIC及智慧裝置的邏輯產品。 南茂可望將享有記憶體市場的強勁成長驅動力，由於主要記憶體廠商嚴格遵循其產品生命周期結束計畫，預期DDR4

內情人士透露，三星本月將記憶體晶片合約價調高30％到60％。該業者通常會在每月公布定價資訊，不過它在10月曾延後發布合約定價的相關資訊。 半導體分銷商Fusion Worldwide總裁哥納曼（Tobey Gonnerman）指出，三星32GB DDR 5記憶體模組11月的合約價，由9月的149美元暴漲至239美元，漲幅高達6成。三星同時將16GB DDR 5和128GB DDR 5晶片價格調漲50％，分別達135美元和1,194美元。 此外，64GB DDR 5和96GB DDR 5記憶體模組的漲幅皆超過30％。三星對漲價的消息不予置評。 目前用於伺服器的記憶體晶片價格正不斷狂飆，這恐將增加打造資料中心基建的大型企業壓力。此外，記憶體晶片也用在智慧型手機和電腦等產品，晶片價格上漲也會增加終端產品成本。 哥納曼指稱，許多大型伺服器和資料中心業者都普遍察覺到，他們無法取得足夠的記憶體晶片，得付出相當大的溢價才能取得晶\n時報資訊 ・ 10 小時前",

針對議員質疑新壽提出「除草、更換logo」的費用列入成本不合理一事，李四川表示，從新壽的角度來說，都是他們這三四年來的成本，前面北市府也已經表明，會審查新壽所提出的成本，若確實是發生在T17、18這3年內，北市府還是要認。 李四川說，關於分手費的金額，北市府也已經跟輝達反映過，他們大概都可以概括承受。「輝達要的是一個總價的成本，原則上我們報給他的成本，他是可以接受的。」（新聞來源：中時即時

Diligence）」報告給議會。民進黨台北市議員顏若芳認為市府審議太鬆，尤其是針對利息3.74%，市府應拒絕，從相關細項來看，市府幾乎是照單全收。王瑞雲答詢，議員提到3.74%利息是經市府委任會計</p>中央社財經 ・ 2 天前<head rend=\"h3\">《產業》三黨均未提反對意見

台北市議會大會12日審查市府提出有關與新壽解約「分手費」動域平均地權基金的報告案，審查前藍綠議員都發表意見。其中民進黨議會黨團總召陳慈慧也代表黨團發表意見，她表示，民進黨團希望國民黨及民眾黨團能夠共同支持新壽解約，讓輝達能落腳台北市，請大家「支持輝達、盡速簽約」，接著議場內的民進黨議員們也一起高呼口號。 國民黨議員游淑慧則表示，非常謝謝民進黨團議員們願意支持蔣市府，爭取輝達落地台北，這個案子通過議會備查應無任何疑義，雖然部分議員都對新壽送來的帳單有些匪夷所思，但仍應以大局為重，藍綠白為了輝達落地而排除萬難，支持市府所有的行政流程。 游淑慧也透露，新壽提出的項目中，北市府後續砍了4000多萬，就她了解後居然是連未來還沒有付出的帳單，都送給北市府，這實在是需要好好把關。

市議會昨開大會審查市府動用平均地權基金支付新壽「分手費」提案，現場藍綠白議員一片融洽，民進黨團總召陳慈慧表示，黨團希望國民黨、民眾黨能共同支持新壽解約，讓輝達能落腳台北，「請大家支持輝達、盡速簽約」，接著議場所有綠營市議員一起高呼口號，還笑稱「沒跟著喊是假支持」。 國民黨市議員吳世正稱讚李四川處理輝達總部案從從容容，感謝支持執政黨、支持蔣市府，民進黨市議員立刻高喊「是支持輝達」！ 李四川說，新壽「分手費」44.34億元中，34.5億元為繳給市府的權利金、租金及中央稅款，其餘近9.85億元被視為新壽提出的成本；而新壽已繳交給中央的稅金、繳給北市府的土地租金共14.41億元，輝達願意概括承受。 他指出，輝達需求T17、18兩塊土地合併，加上14.41億元後\n時報資訊 ・ 2 天前Q3獲利季增166%轉盈！三大法人砸12.7億元

地政局估下週簽約\n（中央社記者劉建邦台北2025年11月13日電）台北市政府與新壽合意終止地上權契約案，送議會備查通過。地政局長王瑞雲今天赴議會委員會報告說，已在確認合意解約協議書文字，經新壽確定後，估雙方有機會下週可簽約。台北市議會昨天討論由台北市政府報告與新壽簽訂合意終止T17、T18市有土地設定地上權契約的備查案，經討論後通過。市議會民政委員會今天召開專案報告，包含輝達總部進駐進度等案。民進黨台北市議員許淑華在委員會問及市府與新壽簽訂解約的明確時程。列席的王瑞雲說，目前估在11月底前，雙方仍在確認協議書的文字。許淑華說，議會已通過此備查案，認為市府應盡快與新壽簽約。王瑞雲回應，11月底是保守預估，目前評估是雙方確認協議書文字內容後，由新壽提報董事會確定，預估下週可簽約，會盡力完成。許淑華詢問市府報告提到負債成本率為3.74%，有無向新壽反映要求調降此利息。同黨台北市議員何孟樺要求提供「盡職調查（Due Diligence）」報告給議會。民進黨台北市議員顏若芳認為市府審議太鬆，尤其是針對利息3.74%，市府應拒絕，從相關細項來看，市府幾乎是照單全收。王瑞雲答詢，議員提到3.74%利息是經市府委任會計\n中央社財經 ・ 2 天前《產業》三黨均未提反對意見

台北市議會大會12日審查市府提出有關與新壽解約「分手費」動域平均地權基金的報告案，審查前藍綠議員都發表意見。其中民進黨議會黨團總召陳慈慧也代表黨團發表意見，她表示，民進黨團希望國民黨及民眾黨團能夠共同支持新壽解約，讓輝達能落腳台北市，請大家「支持輝達、盡速簽約」，接著議場內的民進黨議員們也一起高呼口號。 國民黨議員游淑慧則表示，非常謝謝民進黨團議員們願意支持蔣市府，爭取輝達落地台北，這個案子通過議會備查應無任何疑義，雖然部分議員都對新壽送來的帳單有些匪夷所思，但仍應以大局為重，藍綠白為了輝達落地而排除萬難，支持市府所有的行政流程。 游淑慧也透露，新壽提出的項目中，北市府後續砍了4000多萬，就她了解後居然是連未來還沒有付出的帳單，都送給北市府，這實在是需要好好把關。

在法人關注的AI伺服器部分，英業達預期今年年增逾4成，推升其在整體伺服器業務占比達40％～45％；明年在CSP（雲端服務供應商）與新興NeoCloud客戶的需求帶動之下，成長力道將更勝今年，AI伺服器比重可望突破5成。 蔡枝安表示，除採用輝達（NVIDIA）AI GPU的伺服器成長最強外，ASIC專案動能居次，出貨以毛利率較佳的L6型態為主；另在超微（AMD）平台方面，英業達為長期合作夥伴，目前在MI530及下一代MI400／450系列平台持續合作，預期AMD擴展AI伺服器業務亦將帶來利多。 短期營運受前幾季提前拉貨影響，淡旺季週期出現變化，英業達預估第四季業績規模與第一季相當，但隨產品結構優化與生產效率提升，毛利率將回升。 近期市場傳出輝達將在轉換至下一代的Vera Rubin平台後，將指定L10系統供應商，蔡枝安指出，目前並未收到輝達的通知，不過以英業達的產品規畫，將聚焦在L11機櫃式出貨為主。至於從營收面</p>時報資訊 ・ 3 天前<head rend=\"h3\">《電週邊》AI伺服器明年3位數成長

或電路板），由這些合作夥伴負責組裝完整的伺服器機架。\n然而，摩根大通分析師在緯創第三季財報電話會議上觀察到，輝達現正轉向「直接供應整套系統」，提供合作夥伴完整的 Level-10 系統藍圖與預先定義的架構。\n若輝達改採 L10 系統銷售，主要轉變與效益如下：\n統一設計標準： 輝達將主導整個 AI 伺服器機架的實體和電氣架構設計，並將藍圖提供給供應商遵循。這將確保 AI 基礎設施在設計上的統一性，避免供應商各自為政，從而提高整體效率和可靠性。輝達早在推出其 MGX 架構時就已展現出這種定義整個伺服器架構的意圖。\n產品上市時間大幅縮短：由於高達 80% 的系統設計將由輝達預先定義和驗證，開發和交付新型 AI 架構（例如未來可能的 Rubin/Rubin CPX 機架）所需的時間預計將從傳統的 9 至 12 個月，縮短至僅 90 天。\n擴大市場與利潤： 透過銷售完整的系統而非單一元件，輝達不僅能擴大其潛在市場規模（TAM），亦能因負責整個系統的銷售而獲得更高的利潤。\n合作夥伴立場： 儘管角色有所調整，台灣製造供應商仍將是最終產品製造的關鍵環節。緯創對此表示，這種模式對其商業營運並未造成重大不利影響，反而可能是一件好事。\n此策略轉型的最終目標，是將輝達定位為涵蓋其正在開發的整個基礎設施的綜合解決方案提供者，從而加速 AI 系統在全球市場上的普及和使用。\n輝達尚未對此轉變發表官方聲明，業界將持續關注其對 AI 供應鏈生態系統的長遠影響。\n更多鉅亨報導\n•搶奪AI競爭優勢 傳亞馬遜、微軟支持限制輝達晶片出口中國法案\n•還在怕AI泡沫？孫正義賣光輝達 就為了「買更多AI」\n相關內容\nAI伺服器

在法人關注的AI伺服器部分，英業達預期今年年增逾4成，推升其在整體伺服器業務占比達40％～45％；明年在CSP（雲端服務供應商）與新興NeoCloud客戶的需求帶動之下，成長力道將更勝今年，AI伺服器比重可望突破5成。 蔡枝安表示，除採用輝達（NVIDIA）AI GPU的伺服器成長最強外，ASIC專案動能居次，出貨以毛利率較佳的L6型態為主；另在超微（AMD）平台方面，英業達為長期合作夥伴，目前在MI530及下一代MI400／450系列平台持續合作，預期AMD擴展AI伺服器業務亦將帶來利多。 短期營運受前幾季提前拉貨影響，淡旺季週期出現變化，英業達預估第四季業績規模與第一季相當，但隨產品結構優化與生產效率提升，毛利率將回升。 近期市場傳出輝達將在轉換至下一代的Vera Rubin平台後，將指定L10系統供應商，蔡枝安指出，目前並未收到輝達的通知，不過以英業達的產品規畫，將聚焦在L11機櫃式出貨為主。至於從營收面\n時報資訊 ・ 3 天前《電週邊》AI伺服器明年3位數成長

專家分析，由於軟銀正主導OpenAI高達400億美元的投資計劃，並參與美國「星際之門」AI數據中心專案，該項目計劃投資高達5000億美元，因此有籌措現金需求，且有助戰略重心轉移，從輝達等單一的硬體公司，向更廣泛的AI生態延伸，包括機器人（收購ABB機器人事業）、大型語言模型（投資OpenAI）等。

      "text_content": "美中競賽，戰略產業回流 李淳：台積電赴美是必經之路\n台美關稅談判進入最後階段，前駐歐盟代表李淳14日指出，美國要求製造業投資回流的長期目的，是為在美中競爭中獲勝，但如要台積電大舉赴美、要求五五分，是「殺雞取卵」作法，不利於台積電發展，也影響美國勝出。他說，台積電赴美是維持全球供應鏈地位關鍵的必經之路。\n李淳長期專研財經領域又有駐歐經驗，他針對台積電赴美投資是否掏空台灣，及我半導體及供應鏈赴美投資，對台美關稅談判影響進行分析。\n他說，台積電赴美投資1,650億美元，非川普第二任決定，從拜登總統時期就開始醞釀，台積電必然是要跟所有供應鏈夥伴，特別是上游客戶有很多密切討論，才做成決定。半導體產業上中下游都往美國移動，配合整個產業變遷重新調配市場布局，是台積電要維護供應鏈地位最關鍵的能力，也是必經之路。\n他指出，台積電30年來最重要特質就是信任感，包含配合度及彈性。輝達和AMD在AI下游市場打得火熱，但同時都委託台積電生產，顯示信任感就是台積電成功祕方，別人無法複製。\n若國人反對台積電赴美投資，要求留在國內，李淳說，那是破壞台積電跟客戶間的信任感，美國可能因此傾力扶植英特爾，「我們不要去逼人家扶植台積電的對手。」\n先前傳出美國希望台美半導體生產五五分的說法。李淳表示，「這是殺雞取卵的做法」，美國要關鍵戰略產業回流本土的戰略目標，是要在和中國競賽中獲勝，如果五五分，會拖累台積電創新及財務；如台積電被拖累，中國卻出現重大跳躍式突破，競爭勝出目標可能達不成。\n對於外傳美方擬以大額投資換取對等關稅貿易協議，且投資額度介於日韓的5,500億～3,500億美元。李淳說，台灣特色就是電子業跟半導體，且是代工，半導體供應鏈赴美投資，是替美國企業加分，不是競爭，且投資生態系複雜，美方無法幫台灣決定，只要求在美生產要建立生態系。但日韓投資美國會有要求指定項目，這也是為什麼台灣模式和日韓模式並不一樣。\n相關內容\n台積電壓力大！ 他問為何不「減薪降工時」 過來人全說了\n台積電優渥的薪資和福利讓人羨慕。有網友表示，嚮往進入台積電的親戚，入職後只待了半年就離職，他好奇詢問：「台積電為何不降員工年薪，就能減少工時和壓力？」引發熱議。\nEBC東森財經新聞 ・ 1 天前《各報要聞》AI火熱

供應鏈透露，台積電將於13日舉行年度供應鏈管理論壇，目前產能持續滿載，擴廠維持快節奏。2026年資本支出將維持超過400億美元水準；廠務工程業者指出，大客戶在台灣與美國建廠腳步快速推進，以因應龐大產能需求。 台積電10月合併營收達3,674.7億元，月增11％、年增16.9％，再創歷史新高；累計今年前十個月合併營收達3.13兆元，較去年同期成長33.8％。台積電預期，第四季財測合併營收（以美元計）約為322億～334億美元，季減約1％，毛利率則在59％至61％；2025年營收成長幅度上修至年增34～36％，主要動能來自AI相關的結構性強勁需求與非AI終端市場的溫和復甦。 IC設計業界指出，晶圓代工先進製程持續滿載，3奈米與5奈米晶圓供應吃緊，未來數年將持續投入領先製程與先進封裝設施。台積電2奈米作為次世代主流節點，新竹與高雄兩地新廠建置順利，量產時程穩步推進，預期獲利能力將優\n時報資訊 ・ 4 天前《台北股市》AI引爆！台積電開高

AI伺服器出貨動能強勁，撐起台股獲利一片天，其中，台積電單季獲利以4,523.01億元改寫歷史新高，穩居上市櫃獲利冠軍；緯穎也同樣拜AI所賜，第三季每股稅後純益（EPS）高達82.92元，蟬聯EPS王榜首，不僅較第二季65.23元大幅成長，也與亞軍大立光的53.05元，拉開不少差距。 而輝達GB300出貨動能強勁，帶旺鴻海第三季營收衝上2.05兆元，季增15％、年增11％，營收表現亮眼。凱基投顧看好，AI伺服器為鴻海主要營收與每股稅後純益（EPS）成長動能，隨營收規模效應浮現，將幫助其毛利率、營業利益率穩定。 在AI周邊零組件部分，散熱指標奇鋐第三季稅後純益53.39億元，EPS

綜合陸媒報導，中芯國際13日公布財報顯示，第三季銷售總額23.82億美元，年增9.7％，季增7.8％。第三季折合8吋標準邏輯月產能增至102.3萬片，產能利用率達到95.8％，出貨量繼續提升。以地區分類來看，中國、美國、歐亞市場占比分別為86.2％、10.8％和3％。 展望第四季，趙海軍於14日舉行的業績說明會上釋出積極訊號，他表示，第四季為行業淡季，客戶備貨有所放緩，但產業鏈迭代效應持續，公司產線仍處於供不應求狀態。 對於當前製造商對儲存晶片的囤積導致供應緊張，價格大幅上漲，趙海軍表示，AI促使業內的大供應商放棄了少量多樣的碎片化市場，這給了小供應商，以及處於其上游的中芯國際非常大的機會。只要AI還在發展，記憶體的價格會持續很多年。

中鋼、中鴻盤價持平</head><p>【時報-台北電】中鋼及中鴻14日同步開出新盤價全面持平，中鋼認為，適逢年末產業庫存調整，近期國內外鋼需復甦趨緩，短期鋼市維持盤整。考量下游產業仍面臨競爭挑戰，為了順應國際行情並兼顧客戶接單競爭力，因此12月月盤產品全面以平盤開出，並將會持續推動多元方案，確保接單量能。 中鴻表示，近期煤鐵行情持穩，宏觀不確定因素逐漸消除，但考慮下游年末資金與庫存調節，並維持客戶接單動能，因此本次盤價保持平穩。 寶鋼12月平板類產品續以平盤開出，越南台塑河靜熱軋新盤也持平，不過亞洲鋼廠出口報價略微走滑，國際鋼價呈現弱中帶穩態勢。 市場人士預期，目前鋼價沒有動能向上，接近年底就算降價也無法吸引太多買氣，加上中鋼今年單位成本低導致虧損嚴重，因此開平盤是相對最保險的做法。中鋼所有產品價格維持平盤，同日開盤的中鴻包括熱軋、冷軋、鍍鋅等都跟隨老大哥，繼續維持平盤。 中鋼表示，傳統產業持續受終端需求不振與供應鏈風險增加衝擊，經營環境仍面對挑戰。 鐵礦砂價格維持每噸100美元～105美元，冶金煤上漲至每噸195美元～200美元左右，鋼廠成本微幅走升。美國熱軋行情緩步走高至約每噸960美元～970美元；歐盟明年鋼材進口配</p>時報資訊 ・ 6 小時前<head rend=\"h3\">台美首發匯率聲明

政策護盤急急如律令，11月5日及14日加權指數最低都在跌破27,400點之後，引來國家隊積極進場，意圖守月線，不過，14日終場並未守住。 勞動基金運用局14日收盤對外公告，將辦理新制勞基金及國保年金114年度國內投資絕對報酬型委託經營公開徵求受託機構，預計擇優徵選五家受託機構，每家100億元（新制勞退90億元及國保年金10億元）、合計為500億元。

▲豆魚蛋肉類選擇軟嫩、易消化的蛋白質最合適．可以吃：魚肉、瘦肉、水煮蛋、豆腐．避免吃：煎的、炸的、不熟或太韌的肉類▲飲品類檢查前飲品也要注意顏色與成分．可以喝：運動飲料、蜂蜜水、椰子汁等，無渣無色飲品．避免喝：牛奶、優酪乳、乳酪等乳製品 ▲蔬菜類蔬菜不代表都能吃，要選「嫩葉菜」族群．可以吃：菠菜、小黃瓜、香菇．避免吃：竹筍、菜梗、芹菜等粗纖維蔬菜▲水果類果肉軟、水分多的水果比較適合．可以吃：木瓜、哈密瓜、荔枝、西瓜．避免吃：黑棗、芭樂、百香果、柿子等高纖水果▲烹調方式．建議：水煮、汆燙、蒸煮、清炒．避免：煎、烤、炸

中芯：恐衝擊明年汽車、手機業\n【時報-台北電】大陸晶圓代工龍頭中芯國際聯合首席執行長趙海軍14日表示，2025年第四季「淡季不淡」，當前產能仍供不應求，預計全年收入將首次突破90億美元。他並示警，記憶體短缺恐衝擊2026年的汽車、智慧型手機和消費電子產品等行業。 綜合陸媒報導，中芯國際13日公布財報顯示，第三季銷售總額23.82億美元，年增9.7％，季增7.8％。第三季折合8吋標準邏輯月產能增至102.3萬片，產能利用率達到95.8％，出貨量繼續提升。以地區分類來看，中國、美國、歐亞市場占比分別為86.2％、10.8％和3％。 展望第四季，趙海軍於14日舉行的業績說明會上釋出積極訊號，他表示，第四季為行業淡季，客戶備貨有所放緩，但產業鏈迭代效應持續，公司產線仍處於供不應求狀態。 對於當前製造商對儲存晶片的囤積導致供應緊張，價格大幅上漲，趙海軍表示，AI促使業內的大供應商放棄了少量多樣的碎片化市場，這給了小供應商，以及處於其上游的中芯國際非常大的機會。只要AI還在發展，記憶體的價格會持續很多年。 但是，趙海軍警告，當前行業內記憶體價格上漲非常多，記憶體大週期將對終端生產廠商帶來負面影響。無論是汽車、手機還是消費電子類\n時報資訊 ・ 6 小時前《產業》順應行情 中鋼、中鴻盤價持平\n【時報-台北電】中鋼及中鴻14日同步開出新盤價全面持平，中鋼認為，適逢年末產業庫存調整，近期國內外鋼需復甦趨緩，短期鋼市維持盤整。考量下游產業仍面臨競爭挑戰，為了順應國際行情並兼顧客戶接單競爭力，因此12月月盤產品全面以平盤開出，並將會持續推動多元方案，確保接單量能。 中鴻表示，近期煤鐵行情持穩，宏觀不確定因素逐漸消除，但考慮下游年末資金與庫存調節，並維持客戶接單動能，因此本次盤價保持平穩。 寶鋼12月平板類產品續以平盤開出，越南台塑河靜熱軋新盤也持平，不過亞洲鋼廠出口報價略微走滑，國際鋼價呈現弱中帶穩態勢。 市場人士預期，目前鋼價沒有動能向上，接近年底就算降價也無法吸引太多買氣，加上中鋼今年單位成本低導致虧損嚴重，因此開平盤是相對最保險的做法。中鋼所有產品價格維持平盤，同日開盤的中鴻包括熱軋、冷軋、鍍鋅等都跟隨老大哥，繼續維持平盤。 中鋼表示，傳統產業持續受終端需求不振與供應鏈風險增加衝擊，經營環境仍面對挑戰。 鐵礦砂價格維持每噸100美元～105美元，冶金煤上漲至每噸195美元～200美元左右，鋼廠成本微幅走升。美國熱軋行情緩步走高至約每噸960美元～970美元；歐盟明年鋼材進口配\n時報資訊 ・ 6 小時前台美首發匯率聲明

MET-097i：一次月打的GLP-1受體促效劑（主力產品）\n設計為每月注射一次，與諾和諾德Wegovy及禮來Eli Lilly的Zepbound、Mounjaro需每週注射的方式相比，便利性大幅提升。\n在兩項中期臨床試驗中，於28週（28次每週劑量，劑量介於0.4mg至1.2mg）達到安慰劑校正後最高14.1%的體重減輕效果。\n計畫於2025年底啟動後期臨床試驗，並探索口服版本與組合療法的可能性。\n2.

MET-002o：口服版GLP-1候選藥\n正在進行早期臨床試驗，是輝瑞併購後的重要長線布局。\n法人分析預估，若研發進展順利，Metsera整體產品線將具備年峰值銷售額逾50億美元的潛力。\n與市場龍頭比較：仍有進步空間但具差異化亮點\n當前減重藥物市場由禮來與諾和諾德壟斷，兩家公司在肥胖藥類別的營收成長驚人：\n禮來Eli Lilly(LLY-US)\nZepbound於2025年第三季營收達36億美元，年增率高達185%。\nMounjaro同期營收更達65億美元。\n諾和諾德Novo Nordisk(NVO-US)\nWegovy因市場競爭加劇而增速放緩。\n旗下組合型注射劑臨床未達預期後，公司轉向口服版本開發，其新口服減重藥物在試驗中顯示可達16.6%的體重減輕幅度。\n相比之下，輝瑞在注射型減重藥領域完全空白。公司曾因肝毒性疑慮於2023年終止口服GLP-1候選藥lotiglipron，2025年又停止danuglipron的開發，使其減重藥產品線幾乎歸零。Metsera的併購因此被視為輝瑞在肥胖市場的重要翻身契機。\n股權結構：大型創投與科技巨頭皆在列\nMetsera的股權背景也頗具亮點：\nARCH Venture Partners為最大股東，持股超過25%。\nAlphabet Inc持股約4%。\n公司執行董事長為Population Health Partners共同創辦人Clive Meanwell。\n這些投資者的介入，使Metsera在研發策略與資金取得上具有一定擴張力，也增添外界對其產品線的信心。\n輝瑞能否藉併購翻身？市場仍在觀望\n此次併購雖讓輝瑞正式躋身競爭激烈的肥胖藥賽道，但市場亦普遍認為仍需時間驗證Metsera候選藥物在大型後期試驗中的安全性、減重效果以及與現有市場龍頭的差異化競爭力。\n在全球減重治療市場規模預估於2030年前突破千億美元的大背景下，輝瑞此舉被視為其重新搶攻醫藥成長曲線的關鍵一步，後續臨床數據則將成為市場的最終定價依據。",
